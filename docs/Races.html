against him or her when determining experience point penalties for
multiclassing. </div><br><h3 id="race-and-languages">RACE AND LANGUAGES</h3><div>All
characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc,
or halfling also speaks a racial language, as appropriate. A character who has
an Intelligence bonus at 1st level speaks other languages as well, one extra
language per point of Intelligence bonus as a starting character. </div><div>Literacy:
Any character except a barbarian can read and write all the languages he or she
speaks.</div><div>Class-Related
Languages: Clerics, druids, and wizards can choose certain languages as bonus
languages even if they’re not on the lists found in the race descriptions.
These class-related languages are as follows:</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Cleric:
</span><span>Abyssal,
Celestial, Infernal.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Druid:
</span><span>Sylvan.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Wizard:
</span><span>Draconic.</span></div><br><h3 id="small-characters">SMALL CHARACTERS</h3><div>A
Small character gets a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack
rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. A Small character’s carrying
capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character.</div><div>A
Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character.</div><div>A
Small character must use smaller weapons than a Medium character.</div><br><h2 id="humans">HUMANS</h2><div>•
Medium: As Medium creatures, humans have no special bonuses or penalties due to
their size. </div><div>•
Human base land speed is 30 feet. </div><div>•
1 extra feat at 1st level.</div><div>•
4 extra skill points at 1st level and 1 extra skill point at each additional
level.</div><div>&nbsp;•
Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Languages: Any (other than secret languages,
such as Druidic). See the Speak Language skill. </div><div>•
Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass human takes an
experience point penalty, his or her highest-level class does not count.</div><br><h2 id="dwarves">DWARVES</h2><div>•
+2 Constitution, –2 Charisma.</div><div>•
Medium: As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due
to their size.</div><div>•
Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even
when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load
(unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).</div><div>•
Darkvision: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and
white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function
just fine with no light at all.</div><div>•
Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to
notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new
construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky
stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn’t stone but that is disguised
as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10
feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively
searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a
rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth
underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. </div><div>•
Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as
martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.</div><div>•
Stability: A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull
rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying,
riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).</div><div>•
+2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.</div><div>•
+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.</div><div>•
+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids.</div><div>•
+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any time a creature
loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it’s caught
flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too. </div><div>•
+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items.</div><div>•
+2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</div><div>•
Automatic Languages: Common and Dwarven. Bonus Languages: Giant, Gnome, Goblin,
Orc, Terran, and Undercommon.</div><div>•
Favored Class: Fighter. A multiclass dwarf ’s fighter class does not count when
determining whether he takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing</div><br><h2 id="elves">ELVES</h2><div>•
+2 Dexterity, –2 Constitution.</div><div>•
Medium: As Medium creatures, elves have no special bonuses or penalties due to
their size.</div><div>•

Immunity to magic sleep effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus against
enchantment spells or effects.</div><div>•
Low-Light Vision: An elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight,
moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. She retains
the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</div><div>•
Weapon Proficiency: Elves receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency feats for the
longsword, rapier, longbow (including composite longbow), and shortbow
(including composite shortbow) as bonus feats.</div><div>•
+2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes
within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to
notice it as if she were actively looking for it.</div><div>•
Automatic Languages: Common and Elven. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome,
Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan.</div><div>•
Favored Class: Wizard. A multiclass elf ’s wizard class does not count when
determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.</div><br><h2 id="gnomes">GNOMES</h2><div>•
+2 Constitution, –2 Strength.</div><div>•
Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1
size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but he uses
smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting and carrying limits are
three-quarters of those of a Medium character.</div><div>•
Gnome base land speed is 20 feet.</div><div>•
Low-Light Vision: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in starlight,
moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains
the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</div><div>•
Weapon Familiarity: Gnomes may treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons
rather than exotic weapons.</div><div>•
+2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.</div><div>•
Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells
cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those from similar effects.</div><div>•
+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids.</div><div>•
+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any time a
creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it’s
caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too.</div><div>•
+2 racial bonus on Listen checks.</div><div>•
+2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks.</div><div>•
Automatic Languages: Common and Gnome. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven,
Giant, Goblin, and Orc. In addition, a gnome can speak with a burrowing mammal
(a badger, fox, rabbit, or the like, see below). This ability is innate to
gnomes. See the <span style="font-style: italic;">speak with animals </span>spell description.</div><div>•
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—<span style="font-style: italic;">speak with animals </span>(burrowing mammal only,
duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma score of at least 10 also has the
following spell-like abilities: 1/day—<span style="font-style: italic;">dancing lights, ghost sound,
prestidigitation. </span>Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome’s Cha modifier +
spell level.</div><div>•
Favored Class: Bard. A multiclass gnome’s bard class does not count when
determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.</div><br><h2 id="half-elves">HALF-ELVES</h2><div>•
Medium: As Medium creatures, half-elves have no special bonuses or penalties
due to their size.</div><div>•
Half-elf base land speed is 30 feet.</div><div>•

bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.</div><div>•

experience point penalty, her highest-level class does not count.</div><br><h2 id="half-orcs">HALF-ORCS</h2><div>•
+2 Strength, –2 Intelligence, –2 Charisma.</div><div>A
half-orc’s starting Intelligence score is always at least 3. If this adjustment
would lower the character’s score to 1 or 2, his score is nevertheless 3.</div><div>•
Medium: As Medium creatures, half-orcs have no special bonuses or penalties due
to their size.</div><div>•
Half-orc base land speed is 30 feet.</div><div>•
Darkvision: Half-orcs (and orcs) can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision

count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.</div><br><h2 id="halflings">HALFLINGS</h2><div>•
+2 Dexterity, –2 Strength.</div><div>•
Small: As a Small creature, a halfling gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a
