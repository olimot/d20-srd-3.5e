id="h1-0-salient-divine-abilities"><h1>SALIENT DIVINE ABILITIES</h1><p data-keyword="A salient divine ability is like a feat—it gives a deity a new capability or improves one that the deity already has. A deity has one salient divine ability for each divine rank the deity has, plus additional salient divine abilities reflecting its status">A salient divine ability is like a feat—it gives a deity a new capability or improves one that the deity already has. A deity has one salient divine ability for each divine rank the deity has, plus additional salient divine abilities reflecting its status: Demigods receive one bonus ability, lesser deities receive two bonus abilities, intermediate deities receive three, and greater deities receive five. </p><p>Some salient divine abilities have prerequisites. Usually, the deity must have all the listed prerequisites to have the ability. A divine rank of 1 is a prerequisite for all salient divine abilities. The most common salient divine abilities are described here. A few deities have unique salient divine abilities that are described in the deity’s individual entry.</p><p data-keyword="Using Salient Divine Abilities"><strong>Using Salient Divine Abilities:</strong> Using a salient divine ability is a standard action unless otherwise noted in the ability description. Using a salient divine ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p data-keyword="Salient Divine Abilities and Antimagic"><strong>Salient Divine Abilities and Antimagic:</strong> A salient divine ability functions normally within an antimagic field, and is never subject to spell resistance.</p><section id="h3-1-salient-divine-ability-descriptions"><h3>Salient Divine Ability Descriptions</h3><p>Here is the format for salient divine ability descriptions.</p></section><section id="h3-2-ability-name"><h3>Ability Name</h3><p data-keyword="Prerequisite"><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> A minimum divine rank, minimum ability score, another salient divine ability, a minimum base attack bonus, a feat, a skill, or some other condition that a deity must have in order to acquire this salient divine ability. This entry is absent if a salient divine ability has no prerequisite. An ability may have more than one prerequisite. All salient divine abilities have a minimum prerequisite of divine rank 1. Quasi-deities (rank 0) have no salient divine abilities.</p><p data-keyword="Benefit"><strong>Benefit:</strong> What the ability enables the deity to do. If a deity has the same ability more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description. In general, having a salient divine ability twice is the same as having it once.</p><p data-keyword="Notes"><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional facts about the ability that may be helpful when using the ability in play.</p><p data-keyword="Rest"><strong>Rest:</strong> Some abilities require the deity to rest afterward. If no rest is required, the entry is absent. A resting deity can engage in light activities such as talking or walking at half speed. When attempting anything more strenuous than that, the deity can only take partial actions and suffers a –6 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The deity cannot use another ability that requires rest until its current rest requirement is fulfilled. Any time the deity spends performing strenuous activities does not count toward the required rest time. </p><p data-keyword="Suggested Portfolio Elements"><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> This entry gives one or more portfolio elements that are associated with the salient divine ability in question. The information is provided as guidance and should not be taken as a rule.</p></section><section id="h3-3-alter-form"><h3>Alter Form</h3><p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p><p data-keyword="Prerequisite"><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Alter Size salient divine ability.</p><p data-keyword="Benefit"><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a move-equivalent action, the deity can alter its form, including clothing and equipment. The assumed form must be corporeal. The deity’s body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs. If the form selected has wings, the deity can fly.

A lesser deity can have up to five avatars at once, an intermediate deity can have up to ten, and a greater deity can have up to twenty avatars at once. It takes a deity one year to create an avatar or replace a destroyed avatar. The process does not require any special effort on the deity’s</p><p>part.

This ability works like the <i>discern lies</i> spell, except that it works continuously and applies to any creature the deity can perceive. The deity also can enchant creatures so they become truthful. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. The enchanted creatures become unable to utter any deliberate falsehoods or evasions of truth for one day. The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) to resist.

Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, swoop and rake, and constriction; but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, energy effect, and the like), and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so on). A body with extra limbs does not allow the deity to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings. The deity’s speed is that of the assumed form or the deity’s normal speed, whichever is higher.</p><p>In general, any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form.

The deity retains its outsider type, extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities.</p><p>The deity also retains its divine Armor Class bonus and divine qualities and abilities, provided they are not supernatural.</p><p>The deity can cast spells for which it has components. It needs a voice like that of a humanoid for verbal components and hands like those of a humanoid for somatic components, Likewise, the deity needs hands to use many of its powers, such as creating objects related to its portfolio.</p><p>When the shape shift occurs, the deity’s equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form.
