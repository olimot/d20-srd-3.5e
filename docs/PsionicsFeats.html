class="DocumentView_document__6BYNb"><p>This material is Open Game Content, and is licensed for public use under the terms of the Open Game License v1.0a.</p><section id="h1-0-psionic-feats"><h1>PSIONIC FEATS</h1><p>Psionic feats are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest powers. (In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have psi-like abilities.)</p><p>Because psionic feats are supernatural abilities—a departure from the general rule that feats do not grant supernatural abilities—they cannot be disrupted in combat (as powers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resistance and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed, such as a <i>null psionics field.</i> Leaving such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.</p><p>Many psionic feats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to expend your psionic focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for which you expended it.</p><section id="h2-1-psionic-item-creation-feats"><h2>PSIONIC ITEM CREATION FEATS</h2><p>Manifesters can use their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is draining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.</p><p>A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.</p><p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.</p><p><strong>Raw Materials Cost:</strong> Creating a psionic item requires costly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.</p><p>Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and other equipment. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he’s traveling far from home).</p><p><strong>Time:</strong> The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.</p><p><strong>Item Cost:</strong> Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that directly reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items depends on their manifester level—that is, a power from such an item has the strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that level. Often, that is the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item, the item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power points, the character’s effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other level-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according to the effective manifester level.</p><p>The price of psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on the level of the power and a character’s manifester level. The character’s manifester level must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.</p><p><em>Power Stones:</em> Base price = power level x manifester level x 25 gp</p><p><em>Psionic Tattoos:</em> Base price = power level x manifester level x 50 gp</p><p><em>Dorjes:</em> Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp</p><p><strong>Extra Costs:</strong> Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. </p><p>For psionic tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty times the XP cost. </p><p>Some psionic items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p></section><section id="h2-2-metapsionic-feats"><h2>METAPSIONIC FEATS</h2><p>As a manifester’s knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is more expensive than manifesting the power normally.</p><p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> Powers manifested using metapsionic feats take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat description specifically says otherwise.</p><p><strong>Manifestation Cost:</strong> To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic character must both expend his psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat description.</p><p><strong>Limits on Use:</strong> As with all powers, you cannot spend more power points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this rule. </p><p><strong>Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power:</strong> In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at its original power level, even though it costs additional power points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can’t use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other device.</p><p>Manifesting a power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>Some metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.</p><p><strong>Psionic Items and Metapsionic Powers:</strong> With the right psionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone, psionic tattoo, or dorje. Level limits for psionic tattoos apply to the power’s higher metapsionic level. </p><p>A character doesn’t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a metapsionic power is stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such an item.</p></section></section><section id="h1-3-feat-descriptions"><h1>FEAT DESCRIPTIONS</h1><p>These feat descriptions follow the standard format.</p><section id="h2-4-aligned-attack-psionic"><h2>ALIGNED ATTACK <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h2><p>Your melee or ranged attack overcomes your opponent’s alignment-based damage reduction and deals additional damage.</p><p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +6.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you take this feat, choose either chaos, good, evil or law.

At 15th level, you can increase your effective manifester level by three, but you take 5d8 points of damage.</p><p>The effective increase in manifester level increases the number of power points you can expend on a single power manifestation, as well as increasing all manifester level-dependent effects, such as range, duration, and overcoming power resistance.</p><p><strong>Normal:</strong> Your manifester level is equal to your total levels in classes that manifest powers.</p></section><section id="h2-52-power-penetration-psionic"><h2>POWER PENETRATION <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h2><p>Your powers are especially potent, breaking through power resistance more readily than normal.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.

At any time when you need to expend your psionic focus, you can expend your psicrystal’s psionic focus instead, as long as the crystal is within 5 feet of you.

Once per round when you would normally be hit by a projectile or a thrown weapon no more than one size category larger than your size, you can deflect the attack so that you take no damage from it. The attack is deflected back at your attacker, using the attack bonus of the original attack on you. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed.

Scribing a psionic tattoo takes one day. When you create a psionic tattoo, you set the manifester level. The manifester level must be sufficient to manifest the power in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a psionic tattoo is its power level x its manifester level x 50 gp. To scribe a tattoo, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (special inks, masterwork needles, and so on) costing one-half of this base price.</p><p>When you create a psionic tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when manifesting the power.</p><p>When its wearer physically activates the tattoo, the wearer is the target of the power.</p><p>Any psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.

You can split psionic rays you manifest. The split ray affects any two targets that are both within the power’s range and within 30 feet of each other. If the ray deals damage, each target takes as much damage as a single target would take.</p><p>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2.</p></section><section id="h2-75-stand-still-general"><h2>STAND STILL <small>[GENERAL]</small></h2><p>You can prevent foes from fleeing or closing.</p><p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Str 13.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When a foe’s movement out of a square you threaten grants you an attack of opportunity, you can give up that attack and instead attempt to stop your foe in his tracks. Make your attack of opportunity normally. If you hit your foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your damage roll (the opponent does not actually take damage), or immediately halt as if he had used up his move actions for the round.</p><p>Since you use the Stand Still feat in place of your attack of opportunity, you can do so only a number of times per round equal to the number of times per round you could make an attack of opportunity (normally just one).</p><p><strong>Normal:</strong> Attacks of opportunity cannot halt your foes in their tracks.</p></section><section id="h2-76-talented-psionic"><h2>TALENTED <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h2><p>You can overchannel powers with less cost to yourself.</p><p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Overchannel.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When manifesting a power of 3rd level or lower, you do not take damage from overchanneling.</p></section><section id="h2-77-twin-power-metapsionic"><h2>TWIN POWER <small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h2><p>You can manifest a power simultaneously with another power just like it.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can twin a power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a twinned <i>psionic charm</i>, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect).</p><p>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.</p></section><section id="h2-78-unavoidable-strike-psionic"><h2>UNAVOIDABLE STRIKE <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h2><p>You can make an unarmed strike or use a natural weapon against your foe as if delivering a touch attack.</p><p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Str 13, Psionic Fist, base attack bonus +5.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can resolve your unarmed strike or attack with a natural weapon as a touch attack.</p><p>You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.</p></section><section id="h2-79-unconditional-power-metapsionic"><h2>UNCONDITIONAL POWER <small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h2><p>Disabling conditions do not hold you back.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Your mental strength is enough to overcome some otherwise disabling conditions. You can manifest an unconditional power when you are dazed, <i>confused,</i> nauseated, shaken, or stunned.</p><p>Only personal powers and powers that affect your person can be manifested as unconditional powers.</p><p>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 8. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.</p></section><section id="h2-80-up-the-walls-psionic"><h2>UP THE WALLS <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h2><p>You can run on walls for brief distances.</p><p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wis 13.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your move actions to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> You can take other move actions in conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance, the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the area you threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you fall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of opportunity.</p></section><section id="h2-81-widen-power-metapsionic"><h2>WIDEN POWER <small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h2><p>You can increase the area of your powers.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped power to increase its area. (Powers that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.) Any numeric measurements of the power’s area increase by 100%.</p><p>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.</p></section><section id="h2-82-wild-talent-general"><h2>WILD TALENT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h2><p>Your mind wakes to a previously unrealized talent for psionics.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your latent power of psionics flares to life, conferring upon you the designation of a psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a reserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats. You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest powers simply by virtue of having this feat.</p></section><section id="h2-83-wounding-attack-psionic"><h2>WOUNDING ATTACK <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h2><p>Your vicious attacks wound your foe.</p><p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +8.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can make an attack with such vicious force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1 point of Constitution damage to your foe in addition to the usual damage dealt.</p><p>You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.</p></section></section></div></main></div><nav class="Layout_sidebar__2Jy-3"><div><div class="SearchForm_searchBox__9EPie

ability to manifest powers. (In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have psi-like abilities.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause psionic feats are supernatural abilities—a departure from the general rule that feats do not grant supernatural abilities—they cannot be disrupted in combat (as powers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resistance and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed, such as a \u003ci\u003enull psionics field.\u003c/i\u003e Leaving such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany psionic feats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to expend your psionic focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for which you expended it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csection id=\"h2-1-psionic-item-creation-feats\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePSIONIC ITEM CREATION FEATS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eManifesters can use their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is draining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eXP Cost:\u003c/strong\u003e Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRaw Materials Cost:\u003c/strong\u003e Creating a psionic item requires costly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and other equipment. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he’s traveling far from home).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTime:\u003c/strong\u003e The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eItem Cost:\u003c/strong\u003e Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that directly reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items depends on their manifester level—that is, a power from such an item has the strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that level. Often, that is the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item, the item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power points, the character’s effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other level-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according to the effective manifester level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe price of psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on the level of the power and a character’s manifester level. The character’s manifester level must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePower Stones:\u003c/em\u003e Base price = power level x manifester level x 25 gp\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePsionic Tattoos:\u003c/em\u003e Base price = power level x manifester level x 50 gp\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDorjes:\u003c/em\u003e Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExtra Costs:\u003c/strong\u003e Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor psionic tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty times the XP cost. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome psionic items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003csection id=\"h2-2-metapsionic-feats\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMETAPSIONIC FEATS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a manifester’s knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or learned.

The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can’t use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other device.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eManifesting a power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePsionic Items and Metapsionic Powers:\u003c/strong\u003e With the right psionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone, psionic tattoo, or dorje.

The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely.
