class="DocumentView_document__6BYNb"><p>This material is Open Game Content, and is licensed for public use under the terms of the Open Game License v1.0a.</p><section id="h1-0-psionic-feats"><h1>PSIONIC FEATS</h1><p>Psionic feats are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest powers. (In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have psi-like abilities.)</p><p>Because psionic feats are supernatural abilities—a departure from the general rule that feats do not grant supernatural abilities—they cannot be disrupted in combat (as powers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resistance and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed, such as a <i>null psionics field.</i> Leaving such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.</p><p>Many psionic feats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to expend your psionic focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for which you expended it.</p><section id="h3-1-psionic-item-creation-feats"><h3>PSIONIC ITEM CREATION FEATS</h3><p>Manifesters can use their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is draining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.</p><p>A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.</p><p aria-label="XP Cost"><strong>XP Cost:</strong> Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.</p><p aria-label="Raw Materials Cost"><strong>Raw Materials Cost:</strong> Creating a psionic item requires costly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.</p><p>Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and other equipment. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he’s traveling far from home).</p><p aria-label="Time"><strong>Time:</strong> The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.</p><p aria-label="Item Cost"><strong>Item Cost:</strong> Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that directly reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items depends on their manifester level—that is, a power from such an item has the strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that level. Often, that is the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item, the item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power points, the character’s effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other level-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according to the effective manifester level.</p><p>The price of psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on the level of the power and a character’s manifester level. The character’s manifester level must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.</p><p aria-label="Power Stones"><i>Power Stones:</i> Base price = power level x manifester level x 25 gp</p><p aria-label="Psionic Tattoos"><i>Psionic Tattoos:</i> Base price = power level x manifester level x 50 gp</p><p aria-label="Dorjes"><i>Dorjes:</i> Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp</p><p aria-label="Extra Costs"><strong>Extra Costs:</strong> Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. </p><p>For psionic tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty times the XP cost. </p><p>Some psionic items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p></section><section id="h3-2-metapsionic-feats"><h3>METAPSIONIC FEATS</h3><p>As a manifester’s knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is more expensive than manifesting the power normally.</p><p aria-label="Manifesting Time"><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> Powers manifested using metapsionic feats take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat description specifically says otherwise.</p><p aria-label="Manifestation Cost"><strong>Manifestation Cost:</strong> To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic character must both expend his psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat description.</p><p aria-label="Limits on Use"><strong>Limits on Use:</strong> As with all powers, you cannot spend more power points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this rule. </p><p aria-label="Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power"><strong>Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power:</strong> In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at its original power level, even though it costs additional power points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can’t use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other device.</p><p>Manifesting a power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>Some metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.</p><p aria-label="Psionic Items and Metapsionic Powers"><strong>Psionic Items and Metapsionic Powers:</strong> With the right psionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone, psionic tattoo, or dorje. Level limits for psionic tattoos apply to the power’s higher metapsionic level. </p><p>A character doesn’t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a metapsionic power is stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such an item.</p></section><section id="h2-3-feat-descriptions"><h2>FEAT DESCRIPTIONS</h2><p>These feat descriptions follow the standard format.</p><section id="h3-4-aligned-attack-psionic"><h3>ALIGNED ATTACK <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><p>Your melee or ranged attack overcomes your opponent’s alignment-based damage reduction and deals additional damage.</p><p aria-label="Prerequisite"><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +6.</p><p aria-label="Benefit"><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you take this feat, choose either chaos, good, evil or law.

The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely.

Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resistance and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed, such as a \u003ci\u003enull psionics field.\u003c/i\u003e Leaving such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany psionic feats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to expend your psionic focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for which you expended it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csection id=\"h3-1-psionic-item-creation-feats\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePSIONIC ITEM CREATION FEATS\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eManifesters can use their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is draining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp aria-label=\"XP Cost\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eXP Cost:\u003c/strong\u003e Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp aria-label=\"Raw Materials Cost\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRaw Materials Cost:\u003c/strong\u003e Creating a psionic item requires costly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and other equipment. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he’s traveling far from home).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp aria-label=\"Time\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTime:\u003c/strong\u003e The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item.

Often, that is the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item, the item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power points, the character’s effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other level-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according to the effective manifester level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe price of psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on the level of the power and a character’s manifester level. The character’s manifester level must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp aria-label=\"Power Stones\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePower Stones:\u003c/i\u003e Base price = power level x manifester level x 25 gp\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp aria-label=\"Psionic Tattoos\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePsionic Tattoos:\u003c/i\u003e Base price = power level x manifester level x 50 gp\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp aria-label=\"Dorjes\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eDorjes:\u003c/i\u003e Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp aria-label=\"Extra Costs\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExtra Costs:\u003c/strong\u003e Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor psionic tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item.
