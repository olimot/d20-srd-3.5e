ABILITIES &amp; CONDITIONS</h1><br><h2 id="special-abilities">SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2><div>A
special ability is either extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural in nature.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Extraordinary
Abilities (Ex):</span><span>
Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical. They are, however, not something that
just anyone can do or even learn to do without extensive training. Effects or
areas that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell-Like
Abilities (Sp):</span><span>
Spell-like abilities, as the name implies, are spells and magical abilities
that are very much like spells. Spell-like abilities are subject to spell
resistance and <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic</span>. They do not function in areas where magic
is suppressed or negated (such as an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field</span>).</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Supernatural
Abilities (Su):</span><span>
Supernatural abilities are magical but not spell-like. Supernatural abilities
are not subject to spell resistance and do not function in areas where magic is
suppressed or negated (such as an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field</span>). A supernatural
ability’s effect cannot be dispelled and is not subject to counterspells. See
the table below for a summary of the types of special abilities.</span></div><br><div class="table-container"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 0px none rgb(128, 128, 128); width: 36.5em; padding: 0px;"><tbody><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid"><td width="427" colspan="4" valign="top" style="width: 42.6em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Table: Special Ability Types</td></tr><tr><td width="136" valign="top" style="width: 12.4em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);"></td><td width="104" valign="top" style="width: 8.25em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Extraordinary</td><td width="79" valign="top" style="width: 5.92em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Spell-Like</td><td width="108" valign="top" style="width: 7.95em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Supernatural</td></tr><tr><td width="136" valign="top" style="width: 13.6em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Dispel</td><td width="104" valign="top" style="width: 9.6em; padding: 0px 0.52em; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">No</td><td width="79" valign="top" style="width: 6.22em; padding: 0px 0.52em; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yes</td><td width="108" valign="top" style="width: 9em; padding: 0px 0.52em; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">No</td></tr><tr><td width="136" valign="top" style="width: 12.8em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Spell

attacks cause ability score loss, either ability damage or ability drain.
Points lost to ability damage return at the rate of 1 point per day (or double
that if the character gets complete bed rest) to each damaged ability, and the
spells <span style="font-style: italic;">lesser restoration </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">restoration </span>offset ability damage
as well. Ability drain, however, is permanent, though <span style="font-style: italic;">restoration </span>can
restore even those lost ability score points.</div><div>While
any loss is debilitating, losing all points in an ability score can be
devastating.</div><div>•
Strength 0 means that the character cannot move at all. He lies helpless on the
ground.</div><div>•
Dexterity 0 means that the character cannot move at all. He stands motionless,
rigid, and helpless.</div><div>•
Constitution 0 means that the character is dead.</div><div>•
Intelligence 0 means that the character cannot think and is unconscious in a
coma-like stupor, helpless.</div><div>•
Wisdom 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a deep sleep filled with
nightmares, helpless.</div><div>•
Charisma 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a catatonic, coma-like
stupor, helpless.</div><div>Keeping
track of negative ability score points is never necessary. A character’s
ability score can’t drop below 0.</div><div>Having
a score of 0 in an ability is different from having no ability score
whatsoever.</div><div>Some
spells or abilities impose an effective ability score reduction, which is
different from ability score loss. Any such reduction disappears at the end of
the spell’s or ability’s duration, and the ability score immediately returns to
its former value.</div><div>If
a character’s Constitution score drops, then he loses 1 hit point per Hit Die
for every point by which his Constitution modifier drops. A hit point score
can’t be reduced by Constitution damage or drain to less than 1 hit point per
Hit Die.</div><div>The
ability that some creatures have to drain ability scores is a supernatural one,
requiring some sort of attack. Such creatures do not drain abilities from
enemies when the enemies strike them, even with unarmed attacks or natural
weapons.</div><br><h3 id="antimagic">ANTIMAGIC</h3><div>An
<span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field </span>spell or effect cancels magic altogether. An antimagic
effect has the following powers and characteristics.</div><div>•
No supernatural ability, spell-like ability, or spell works in an area of
antimagic (but extraordinary abilities still work).</div><div>•
Antimagic does not dispel magic; it suppresses it. Once a magical effect is no
longer affected by the antimagic (the antimagic fades, the center of the effect
moves away, and so on), the magic returns. Spells that still have part of their
duration left begin functioning again, magic items are once again useful, and
so forth.</div><div>•
Spell areas that include both an antimagic area and a normal area, but are not
centered in the antimagic area, still function in the normal area. If the
spell’s center is in the antimagic area, then the spell is suppressed.</div><div>•
Golems and other constructs, elementals, outsiders, and corporeal undead, still
function in an antimagic area (though the antimagic area suppresses their
spellcasting and their supernatural and spell-like abilities normally). If such
creatures are summoned or conjured, however, see below. </div><div>•
Summoned or conjured creatures of any type, as well as incorporeal undead, wink
out if they enter the area of an antimagic effect. They reappear in the same
spot once the field goes away.</div><div>•
Magic items with continuous effectsdo not function in the area of an
antimagic effect, but their effects are not canceled (so the contents of a <span style="font-style: italic;">bag
of holding</span> are unavailable, but neither spill out nor disappear forever).</div><div>•
Two antimagic areas in the same place do not cancel each other out, nor do they
stack.</div><div>•
<span style="font-style: italic;">Wall of force, prismatic wall, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">prismatic sphere </span>are not
affected by antimagic. <span style="font-style: italic;">Break enchantment, dispel magic, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">greater
dispel magic </span>spells do not dispel antimagic. <span style="font-style: italic;">Mage’s disjunction </span>has
a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field. </span>If the <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic
field </span>survives the <span style="font-style: italic;">disjunction, </span>no items within it are disjoined.</div><br><h3 id="blindsight-and-blindsense">BLINDSIGHT AND
BLINDSENSE</h3><div>Some
creatures have blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense
(or a combination of such senses) to operate effectively without vision. Such
sense may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute scent, keen hearing, or
echolocation. This ability makes invisibility and concealment (even magical
darkness) irrelevant to the creature (though it still can’t see ethereal
creatures). This ability operates out to a range specified in the creature
description.</div><div>•
Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A
creature cannot read with blindsight.</div><div>•
Blindsight does not subject a creature to gaze attacks (even though darkvision
does).</div><div>•
Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures using blindsight. </div><div>•
Deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.</div><div>•
Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.</div><div>•
Blindsight negates displacement and blur effects.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Blindsense:</span><span> Other creatures have
blindsense, a lesser ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot
see, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense
usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice and locate
creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of
effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see has total
concealment (50% miss chance) against the creature with blindsense, and the
blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that
have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with
blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to
Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.</span></div><br><h3 id="breath-weapon">BREATH WEAPON</h3><div>A
creature attacking with a breath weapon is actually expelling something from
its mouth (rather than conjuring it by means of a spell or some other magical
effect). Most creatures with breath weapons are limited to a number of uses per
day or by a minimum length of time that must pass between uses. Such creatures
are usually smart enough to save their breath weapon until they really need it.</div><div>•
Using a breath weapon is typically a standard action.</div><div>•
No attack roll is necessary. The breath simply fills its stated area.</div><div>•
Any character caught in the area must make the appropriate saving throw or
suffer the breath weapon’s full effect. In many cases, a character who succeeds
on his saving throw still takes half damage or some other reduced effect.</div><div>•
Breath weapons are supernatural abilities except where noted.</div><div>•
Creatures are immune to their own breath weapons.</div><div>•
Creatures unable to breathe can still use breath weapons. (The term is
something of a misnomer.)</div><br><h3 id="charm-and-compulsion">CHARM AND
COMPULSION</h3><div>Many
abilities and spells can cloud the minds of characters and monsters, leaving
them unable to tell friend from foe—or worse yet, deceiving them into thinking
that their former friends are now their worst enemies. Two general types of
enchantments affect characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.</div><div>Charming
another creature gives the charming character the ability to befriend and
suggest courses of actions to his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or
mindless. Charms of this type include the various <span style="font-style: italic;">charm </span>spells. Essentially,
a <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character retains free will but makes choices according to a
skewed view of the world.</div><div>•
A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>creature doesn’t gain any magical ability to understand his
new friend’s language.</div><div>•
A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character retains his original alignment and allegiances,
generally with the exception that he now regards the <span style="font-style: italic;">charming </span>creature
as a dear friend and will give great weight to his suggestions and directions.</div><div>•
A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character fights his former allies only if they threaten his
new friend, and even then he uses the least lethal means at his disposal as
long as these tactics show any possibility of success (just as he would in a
fight between two actual friends).</div><div>•
A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character is entitled to an opposed Charisma check against his
master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make him do
something he wouldn’t normally do even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he
decides not to go along with that order but remains <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed.</span></div><div>•
A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or
grievously harmful to her.</div><div>•
If the charming creature commands his minion to do something that the
influenced character would be violently opposed to, the subject may attempt a
new saving throw to break free of the influence altogether.</div><div>•
A <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed </span>character who is openly attacked by the creature who <span style="font-style: italic;">charmed
</span>him or by that creature’s apparent allies is automatically freed of the
spell or effect.</div><div>Compulsion
is a different matter altogether. A compulsion overrides the subject’s free will
in some way or simply changes the way the subject’s mind works. A charm makes
the subject a friend of the caster; a compulsion makes the subject obey the
caster.</div><div>Regardless
of whether a character is charmed or compelled, he won’t volunteer information
or tactics that his master doesn’t ask for.</div><br><h3 id="cold-immunity">COLD IMMUNITY</h3><div>A
creature with cold immunity never takes cold damage. It has vulnerability to
fire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from
fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a
success or failure.</div><br><h3 id="damage-reduction">DAMAGE REDUCTION</h3><div>Some
magic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly heal damage from
weapons or to ignore blows altogether as though they were invulnerable.</div><div>The
numerical part of a creature’s damage reduction is the amount of hit points the
creature ignores from normal attacks. Usually, a certain type of weapon can
overcome this reduction. This information is separated from the damage
reduction number by a slash. Damage reduction may be overcome by special
materials, by magic weapons (any weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus,
not counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain types of weapons
(such as slashing or bludgeoning), and weapons imbued with an alignment. If a
dash follows the slash then the damage reduction is effective against any attack
that does not ignore damage reduction.</div><div>Ammunition
fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is
treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains
the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may
already have).</div><div>Whenever
damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates
most special effects that accompany the attack, such as injury type poison, a
monk’s stunning, and injury type disease. Damage reduction does not negate
touch attacks, energy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor
does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or
contact. </div><div>Attacks
that deal no damage because of the target’s damage reduction do not disrupt
spells.</div><div>Spells,
spell-like abilities, and energy attacks (even nonmagical fire) ignore damage
reduction.</div><div>Sometimes
damage reduction is instant healing. Sometimes damage reduction represents the
creature’s tough hide or body,. In either case, characters can see that
conventional attacks don’t work.</div><div>If
a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of
damage reduction do not stack. Instead, the creature gets the benefit of the
best damage reduction in a given situation. </div><br><h3 id="darkvision">DARKVISION</h3><div>Darkvision
is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range
specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot
be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not
see otherwise—invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still
visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to
gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</div><br><h3 id="death-attacks">DEATH ATTACKS</h3><div>In
most cases, a death attack allows the victim a Fortitude save to avoid the
affect, but if the save fails, the character dies instantly.</div><div>•
<span style="font-style: italic;">Raise dead </span>doesn’t work on someone killed by a death attack. </div><div>•
Death attacks slay instantly. A victim cannot be made stable and thereby kept
alive.</div><div>•
In case it matters, a dead character, no matter how she died, has –10 hit
points.</div><div>•
The spell <span style="font-style: italic;">death ward </span>protects a character against these attacks.</div><br><h3 id="disease">DISEASE</h3><div>When
a character is injured by a contaminated attack touches an item smeared with
diseased matter, or consumes disease-tainted food or drink, he must make an
immediate Fortitude saving throw. If he succeeds, the disease has no effect—his
immune system fought off the infection. If he fails, he takes damage after an
incubation period. Once per day afterward, he must make a successful Fortitude
saving throw to avoid repeated damage. Two successful saving throws in a row indicate
that he has fought off the disease and recovers, taking no more damage.</div><div>These
Fortitude saving throws can be rolled secretly so that the player doesn’t know
whether the disease has taken hold.</div><h4 id="disease-descriptions">Disease
Descriptions</h4><div>Diseases
have various symptoms and are spread through a number of vectors. The
characteristics of several typical diseases are summarized on Table: Diseases
and defined below.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Disease:
</span><span>Diseases
whose names are printed in <span style="font-style: italic;">italic </span>in the table are supernatural in
nature. The others are extraordinary.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Infection:
</span><span>The
disease’s method of delivery—ingested, inhaled, via injury, or contact. Keep in
mind that some injury diseases may be transmitted by as small an injury as a
flea bite and that most inhaled diseases can also be ingested (and vice versa).</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">DC:
</span><span>The
Difficulty Class for the Fortitude saving throws to prevent infection (if the
character has been infected), to prevent each instance of repeated damage, and
to recover from the disease.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Incubation
Period: </span><span>The
time before damage begins.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Damage:
</span><span>The
ability damage the character takes after incubation and each day afterward.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Types
of Diseases: </span><span>Typical
diseases include the following:</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Blinding
Sickness: </span><span>Spread
in tainted water.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Cackle
Fever: </span><span>Symptoms
include high fever, disorientation, and frequent bouts of hideous laughter.
Also known as “the shrieks.”</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Demon
Fever: </span><span>Night
hags spread it. Can cause permanent ability drain.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Devil
Chills: </span><span>Barbazu
and pit fiends spread it. It takes three, not two, successful saves in a row to
recover from devil chills.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Filth
Fever: </span><span>Dire
rats and otyughs spread it. Those injured while in filthy surroundings might
also catch it.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Mindfire:
</span><span>Feels
like your brain is burning. Causes stupor.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Mummy
Rot: </span><span>Spread
by mummies. Successful saving throws do not allow the character to recover
(though they do prevent damage normally).</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Red
Ache: </span><span>Skin
turns red, bloated, and warm to the touch.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">The

a Disease</h4><div>Use
of the Heal skill can help a diseased character. Every time a diseased
character makes a saving throw against disease effects, the healer makes a
check. The diseased character can use the healer’s result in place of his
saving throw if the Heal check result is higher. The diseased character must be
in the healer’s care and must have spent the previous 8 hours resting.</div><div>Characters
recover points lost to ability score damage at a rate of 1 per day per ability
damaged, and this rule applies even while a disease is in progress. That means
that a character with a minor disease might be able to withstand it without
accumulating any damage.</div><br><h3 id="energy-drain-and-negative-levels">ENERGY DRAIN AND
NEGATIVE LEVELS</h3><div>Some
horrible creatures, especially undead monsters, possess a fearsome supernatural
ability to drain levels from those they strike in combat. The creature making
an energy drain attack draws a portion of its victim’s life force from her.
Most energy drain attacks require a successful melee attack roll—mere physical
contact is not enough. Each successful energy drain attack bestows one or more
negative levels on the opponent. A creature takes the following penalties for
each negative level it has gained.</div><div>–1
on all skill checks and ability checks.</div><div>–1
on attack rolls and saving throws.</div><div>–5
hit points.</div><div>–1
effective level (whenever the creature’s level is used in a die roll or
calculation, reduce it by one for each negative level). </div><div>If
the victim casts spells, she loses access to one spell as if she had cast her
highest-level, currently available spell. (If she has more than one spell at
her highest level, she chooses which she loses.) In addition, when she next
prepares spells or regains spell slots, she gets one less spell slot at her
highest spell level. </div><div>Negative
levels remain for 24 hours or until removed with a spell, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">restoration.
</span>After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10
+ 1/2 attacker’s HD + attacker’s Cha modifier). (The DC is provided in the
attacker’s description.) If the saving throw succeeds, the negative level goes
away with no harm to the creature. The afflicted creature makes a separate
saving throw for each negative level it has gained. If the save fails, the
negative level goes away, but the creature’s level is also reduced by one.</div><div>A
character with negative levels at least equal to her current level, or drained
below 1st level, is instantly slain. Depending on the creature that killed her,
she may rise the next night as a monster of that kind. If not, she rises as a
wight. A creature gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level it
bestows (though not if the negative level is caused by a spell or similar
effect).</div><br><h3 id="etherealness">ETHEREALNESS</h3><div>Phase
spiders and certain other creatures can exist on the Ethereal Plane. While on
the Ethereal Plane, a creature is called ethereal. Unlike incorporeal
creatures, ethereal creatures are not present on the Material Plane.</div><div>Ethereal
creatures are invisible, inaudible, insubstantial, and scentless to creatures
on the Material Plane. Even most magical attacks have no effect on them. <span style="font-style: italic;">See
invisibility </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">true seeing </span>reveal ethereal creatures.</div><div>An
ethereal creature can see and hear into the Material Plane in a 60-foot radius,
though material objects still block sight and sound. (An ethereal creature
can’t see through a material wall, for instance.) An ethereal creature inside
an object on the Material Plane cannot see. Things on the Material Plane,
however, look gray, indistinct, and ghostly. An ethereal creature can’t affect
the Material Plane, not even magically. An ethereal creature, however,
interacts with other ethereal creatures and objects the way material creatures
interact with material creatures and objects.</div><div>Even
if a creature on the Material Plane can see an ethereal creature the ethereal
creature is on another plane. Only force effects can affect the ethereal
creatures. If, on the other hand, both creatures are ethereal, they can affect
each other normally.</div><div>A
force effect originating on the Material Plane extends onto the Ethereal Plane,
so that a <span style="font-style: italic;">wall of force </span>blocks an ethereal creature, and a <span style="font-style: italic;">magic
missile </span>can strike one (provided the spellcaster can see the ethereal
target). Gaze effects and abjurations also extend from the Material Plane to
the Ethereal Plane. None of these effects extend from the Ethereal Plane to the
Material Plane.</div><div>Ethereal
creatures move in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not
need to walk on the ground, and material objects don’t block them (though they
can’t see while their eyes are within solid material).</div><div>Ghosts
have a power called manifestation that allows them to appear on the Material
Plane as incorporeal creatures. Still, they are on the Ethereal Plane, and
another ethereal creature can interact normally with a manifesting ghost.
Ethereal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as air. Ethereal
creatures do not fall or take falling damage. </div><br><h3 id="evasion-and-improved-evasion">EVASION AND
IMPROVED EVASION</h3><div>These
extraordinary abilities allow the target of an area attack to leap or twist out
of the way. Rogues and monks have evasion and improved evasion as class
features, but certain other creatures have these abilities, too.</div><div>If
subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, a character
with evasion takes no damage on a successful save. </div><div>As
with a Reflex save for any creature, a character must have room to move in
order to evade. A bound character or one squeezing through an area cannot use
evasion.</div><div>As
with a Reflex save for any creature, evasion is a reflexive ability. The
character need not know that the attack is coming to use evasion.</div><div>Rogues
and monks cannot use evasion in medium or heavy armor. Some creatures with the
evasion ability as an innate quality do not have this limitation.</div><div>Improved
evasion is like evasion, except that even on a failed saving throw the
character takes only half damage.</div><br><h3 id="fast-healing">FAST HEALING</h3><div>A
creature with fast healing has the extraordinary ability to regain hit points
at an exceptional rate. Except for what is noted here, fast healing is like
natural healing. </div><div>At
the beginning of each of the creature’s turns, it heals a certain number of hit
points (defined in its description).</div><div>Unlike
regeneration, fast healing does not allow a creature to regrow or reattach lost
body parts.</div><div>A
creature that has taken both nonlethal and lethal damage heals the nonlethal
damage first.</div><div>Fast
healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or
suffocation.</div><div>Fast
healing does not increase the number of hit points regained when a creature
polymorphs.</div><br><h3 id="fear">FEAR</h3><div>Spells,
magic items, and certain monsters can affect characters with fear. In most
cases, the character makes a Will saving throw to resist this effect, and a
failed roll means that the character is shaken, frightened, or panicked.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Shaken:
</span><span>Characters
who are shaken take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks,
and ability checks.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Frightened:</span><span> Characters who are
frightened are shaken, and in addition they flee from the source of their fear
as quickly as they can. They can choose the path of their flight. Other than
that stipulation, once they are out of sight (or hearing) of the source of
their fear, they can act as they want. However, if the duration of their fear
continues, characters can be forced to flee once more if the source of their
fear presents itself again. Characters unable to flee can fight (though they
are still shaken).</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Panicked:
</span><span>Characters
who are panicked are shaken, and they run away from the source of their fear as
quickly as they can. Other than running away from the source, their path is
random. They flee from all other dangers that confront them rather than facing
those dangers. Panicked characters cower if they are prevented from fleeing.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Becoming
Even More Fearful:</span><span> Fear effects are cumulative. A shaken character who is made
shaken again becomes frightened, and a shaken character who is made frightened
becomes panicked instead. A frightened character who is made shaken or
frightened becomes panicked instead.</span></div><br><h3 id="fire-immunity">FIRE IMMUNITY</h3><div>A
creature with fire immunity never takes fire damage. It has vulnerability to
cold, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from
cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a
success or failure.</div><br><h3 id="gaseous-form">GASEOUS FORM</h3><div>Some
creatures have the supernatural or spell-like ability to take the form of a
cloud of vapor or gas.</div><div>Creatures
in gaseous form can’t run but can fly. A gaseous creature can move about and do
the things that a cloud of gas can conceivably do, such as flow through the
crack under a door. It can’t, however, pass through solid matter. Gaseous
creatures can’t attack physically or cast spells with verbal, somatic,
material, or focus components. They lose their supernatural abilities (except
for the supernatural ability to assume gaseous form, of course).</div><div>Creatures
in gaseous form have damage reduction 10/magic. Spells, spell-like abilities,
and supernatural abilities affect them normally. Creatures in gaseous form lose
all benefit of material armor (including natural armor), though size,
Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force armor still apply.</div><div>Gaseous
creatures do not need to breathe and are immune to attacks involving breathing
(troglodyte stench, poison gas, and the like).</div><div>Gaseous
creatures can’t enter water or other liquid. They are not ethereal or
incorporeal. They are affected by winds or other forms of moving air to the
extent that the wind pushes them in the direction the wind is moving. However,
even the strongest wind can’t disperse or damage a creature in gaseous form.</div><div>Discerning
a creature in gaseous form from natural mist requires a DC 15 Spot check.
Creatures in gaseous form attempting to hide in an area with mist, smoke, or
other gas gain a +20 bonus.</div><br><h3 id="gaze-attacks">GAZE ATTACKS</h3><div>While
the medusa’s gaze is well known, gaze attacks can also charm, curse, or even
kill. Gaze attacks not produced by a spell are supernatural.</div><div>Each
character within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw (which can
be a Fortitude or Will save) each round at the beginning of his turn.</div><div>An
opponent can avert his eyes from the creature’s face, looking at the creature’s
body, watching its shadow, or tracking the creature in a reflective surface.
Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance of not having to make a saving throw.
The creature with the gaze attack gains concealment relative to the opponent.
An opponent can shut his eyes, turn his back on the creature, or wear a
blindfold. In these cases, the opponent does not need to make a saving throw.
The creature with the gaze attack gains total concealment relative to the
opponent.</div><div>A
creature with a gaze attack can actively attempt to use its gaze as an attack
action. The creature simply chooses a target within range, and that opponent
must attempt a saving throw. If the target has chosen to defend against the
gaze as discussed above, the opponent gets a chance to avoid the saving throw
(either 50% chance for averting eyes or 100% chance for shutting eyes). It is
possible for an opponent to save against a creature’s gaze twice during the
same round, once before its own action and once during the creature’s action.</div><div>Looking
at the creature’s image (such as in a mirror or as part of an illusion) does
not subject the viewer to a gaze attack.</div><div>A
creature is immune to its own gaze attack.</div><div>If
visibility is limited (by dim lighting, a fog, or the like) so that it results
in concealment, there is a percentage chance equal to the normal miss chance
for that degree of concealment that a character won’t need to make a saving
throw in a given round. This chance is not cumulative with the chance for averting
your eyes, but is rolled separately.</div><div>Invisible
creatures cannot use gaze attacks.</div><div>Characters
using darkvision in complete darkness are affected by a gaze attack normally.</div><div>Unless
specified otherwise, a creature with a gaze attack can control its gaze attack
and “turn it off ” when so desired.</div><br><h3 id="incorporeality">INCORPOREALITY</h3><div>Spectres,
wraiths, and a few other creatures lack physical bodies. Such creatures are
insubstantial and can’t be touched by nonmagical matter or energy. Likewise,
they cannot manipulate objects or exert physical force on objects. However,
incorporeal beings have a tangible presence that sometimes seems like a
physical attack against a corporeal creature. </div><div>Incorporeal
creatures are present on the same plane as the characters, and characters have
some chance to affect them. </div><div>Incorporeal
creatures can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, by magic weapons,
or by spells, spell-like effects, or supernatural effects. They are immune to
all nonmagical attack forms. They are not burned by normal fires, affected by
natural cold, or harmed by mundane acids.</div><div>Even
when struck by magic or magic weapons, an incorporeal creature has a 50% chance
to ignore any damage from a corporeal source—except for a force effector
damage dealt by a ghost touch weapon.</div><div>Incorporeal
creatures are immune to critical hits, extra damage from being favored enemies,
and from sneak attacks. They move in any direction (including up or down) at
will. They do not need to walk on the ground. They can pass through solid
objects at will, although they cannot see when their eyes are within solid
matter. </div><div>Incorporeal
creatures hiding inside solid objects get a +2 circumstance bonus on Listen
checks, because solid objects carry sound well. Pinpointing an opponent from
inside a solid object uses the same rules as pinpointing invisible opponents
(see Invisibility, below). </div><div>Incorporeal
creatures are inaudible unless they decide to make noise.</div><div>The
physical attacks of incorporeal creatures ignore material armor, even magic
armor, unless it is made of force (such as mage armor or bracers of armor) or
has the ghost touch ability. </div><div>Incorporeal
creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air.</div><div>Incorporeal
creatures cannot fall or take falling damage.</div><div>Corporeal
creatures cannot trip or grapple incorporeal creatures. </div><div>Incorporeal
creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.</div><div>Incorporeal
creatures do not leave footprints, have no scent, and make no noise unless they
manifest, and even then they only make noise intentionally.</div><br><h3 id="invisibility">INVISIBILITY</h3><div>The
ability to move about unseen is not foolproof. While they can’t be seen,
invisible creatures can be heard, smelled, or felt. </div><div>Invisibility
makes a creature undetectable by vision, including darkvision.</div><div>Invisibility
does not, by itself, make a creature immune to critical hits, but it does make
the creature immune to extra damage from being a ranger’s favored enemy and
from sneak attacks.</div><div>A
creature can generally notice the presence of an active invisible creature
within 30 feet with a DC 20 Spot check. The observer gains a hunch that
“something’s there” but can’t see it or target it accurately with an attack. A
creature who is holding still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate
object, an unliving creature holding still, or a completely immobile creature
is even harder to spot (DC 40). It’s practically impossible (+20 DC) to
pinpoint an invisible creature’s location with a Spot check, and even if a
character succeeds on such a check, the invisible creature still benefits from
total concealment (50% miss chance).</div><div>A
creature can use hearing to find an invisible creature. A character can make a
Listen check for this purpose as a free action each round. A Listen check
result at least equal to the invisible creature’s Move Silently check result
reveals its presence. (A creature with no ranks in Move Silently makes a Move
Silently check as a Dexterity check to which an armor check penalty applies.) A
successful check lets a character hear an invisible creature “over there
somewhere.” It’s practically impossible to pinpoint the location of an
invisible creature. A Listen check that beats the DC by 20 pinpoints the
invisible creature’s location.</div><div class="table-container"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 0px none rgb(128, 128, 128); width: 27.3em; padding: 0px;"><tbody><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid"><td colspan="2" valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 31.5em;">Listen

creature can grope about to find an invisible creature. A character can make a
touch attack with his hands or a weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using
a standard action. If an invisible target is in the designated area, there is a
50% miss chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals
no damage but has successfully pinpointed the invisible creature’s current
location. (If the invisible creature moves, its location, obviously, is once
again unknown.)</div><div>If
an invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck still knows the
location of the creature that struck him (until, of course, the invisible
creature moves). The only exception is if the invisible creature has a reach
greater than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general
location of the creature but has not pinpointed the exact location.</div><div>If
a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has
pinpointed, he attacks normally, but the invisible creature still benefits from
full concealment (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly large and slow
creature might get a smaller miss chance.</div><div>If
a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has not
pinpointed, have the player choose the space where the character will direct
the attack. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the attack normally. If
the enemy’s not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there, don’t let the
player see the result, and tell him that the character has missed. That way the
player doesn’t know whether the attack missed because the enemy’s not there or
because you successfully rolled the miss chance.</div><div>If
an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible.
One could coat an invisible object with flour to at least keep track of its
position (until the flour fell off or blew away). An invisible creature can
pick up a small visible item and hide it on his person (tucked in a pocket or
behind a cloak) and render it effectively invisible. </div><div>Invisible
creatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud,
or other soft surfaces can give enemies clues to an invisible creature’s
location.</div><div>An
invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location. The
invisible creature, however, is still hard to see and benefits from
concealment.</div><div>A
creature with the scent ability can detect an invisible creature as it would a
visible one.</div><div>A
creature with the Blind-Fight feat has a better chance to hit an invisible
creature. Roll the miss chance twice, and he misses only if both rolls indicate
a miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss chance roll rather than two 50% miss
chance rolls.)</div><div>A
creature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact with) creatures
regardless of invisibility.</div><div>An
invisible burning torch still gives off light, as does an invisible object with
a light spell (or similar spell) cast upon it.</div><div>Ethereal
creatures are invisible. Since ethereal creatures are not materially present,
Spot checks, Listen checks, Scent, Blind-Fight, and blindsight don’t help
locate them. Incorporeal creatures are often invisible. Scent, Blind-Fight, and
blindsight don’t help creatures find or attack invisible, incorporeal
creatures, but Spot checks and possibly Listen checks can help.</div><div>Invisible
creatures cannot use gaze attacks.</div><div>Invisibility
does not thwart <span style="font-style: italic;">detect </span>spells.</div><div>Since
some creatures can detect or even see invisible creatures, it is helpful to be
able to hide even when invisible.</div><br><h3 id="level-loss">LEVEL LOSS</h3><div>A
character who loses a level instantly loses one Hit Die. The character’s base
attack bonus, base saving throw bonuses, and special class abilities are now
reduced to the new, lower level. Likewise, the character loses any ability
score gain, skill ranks, and any feat associated with the level (if applicable).
If the exact ability score or skill ranks increased from a level now lost is
unknown (or the player has forgotten), lose 1 point from the highest ability
score or ranks from the highest-ranked skills. If a familiar or companion
creature has abilities tied to a character who has lost a level, the creature’s
abilities are adjusted to fit the character’s new level.</div><div>The
victim’s experience point total is immediately set to the midpoint of the
previous level.</div><br><h3 id="low-light-vision">LOW-LIGHT VISION</h3><div>Characters
with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can
see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A
spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest
candle flame is next to her as a source of light.</div><div>Characters
with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can
during the day.</div><br><h3 id="paralysis">PARALYSIS</h3><div>Some
monsters and spells have the supernatural or spell-like ability to paralyze
their victims, immobilizing them through magical means. (Paralysis from toxins
is discussed in the Poison section below.)</div><div>A
paralyzed character cannot move, speak, or take any physical action. He is
rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Not even friends can move his limbs.
He may take purely mental actions, such as casting a spell with no components.</div><div>A
winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot
flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.</div><br><h3 id="poison">POISON</h3><div>When
a character takes damage from an attack with a poisoned weapon, touches an item
smeared with contact poison, consumes poisoned food or drink, or is otherwise
poisoned, he must make a Fortitude saving throw. If he fails, he takes the
poison’s initial damage (usually ability damage). Even if he succeeds, he
typically faces more damage 1 minute later, which he can also avoid with a
successful Fortitude saving throw.</div><div>One
dose of poison smeared on a weapon or some other object affects just a single
target. A poisoned weapon or object retains its venom until the weapon scores a
hit or the object is touched (unless the poison is wiped off before a target
comes in contact with it). Any poison smeared on an object or exposed to the
elements in any way remains potent until it is touched or used.</div><div>Although
supernatural and spell-like poisons are possible, poisonous effects are almost
always extraordinary.</div><div>Poisons
can be divided into four basic types according to the method by which their
effect is delivered, as follows.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Contact:</span><span> Merely touching this type
of poison necessitates a saving throw. It can be actively delivered via a
weapon or a touch attack. Even if a creature has sufficient damage reduction to
avoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison can still affect it. A
chest or other object can be smeared with contact poison as part of a trap.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ingested:</span><span> Ingested poisons are
virtually impossible to utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could
administer a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into
drinking or eating something poisoned. Assassins and other characters tend to
use ingested poisons outside of combat.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Inhaled:</span><span> Inhaled poisons are
usually contained in fragile vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged
attack with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is
struck hard), the container releases its poison. One dose spreads to fill the
volume of a 10-foot cube. Each creature within the area must make a saving
throw. (Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons; they
affect the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Injury:</span><span> This poison must be
delivered through a wound. If a creature has sufficient damage reduction to
avoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison does not affect it. Traps
that cause damage from weapons, needles, and the like sometimes contain injury
poisons.</span></div><div>The
characteristics of poisons are summarized on Table: Poisons. Terms on the table
are defined below.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Type:
</span><span>The
poison’s method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or via an injury) and
the Fortitude save DC to avoid the poison’s damage.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Initial
Damage: </span><span>The
damage the character takes immediately upon failing his saving throw against
this poison. Ability damage is temporary unless marked with an asterisk (*), in
which case the loss is a permanent drain. Paralysis lasts for 2d6 minutes.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Secondary
Damage: </span><span>The
amount of damage the character takes 1 minute after exposure as a result of the
poisoning, if he fails a second saving throw. Unconsciousness lasts for 1d3
hours. Ability damage marked with an asterisk is permanent drain instead of
temporary damage.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Price:
</span><span>The cost
of one dose (one vial) of the poison. It is not possible to use or apply poison
in any quantity smaller than one dose. The purchase and possession of poison is
always illegal, and even in big cities it can be obtained only from
specialized, less than reputable sources.</span></div><h4 id="perils-of-using-poison">Perils of Using Poison</h4><div>A
character has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a poison whenever he applies
it to a weapon or otherwise readies it for use. Additionally, a character who
rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon must make a DC 15
Reflex save or accidentally poison himself with the weapon.</div><h4 id="poison-immunities">Poison Immunities</h4><div>Creatures
with natural poison attacks are immune to their own poison. Nonliving creatures
(constructs and undead) and creatures without metabolisms (such as elementals)
are always immune to poison. Oozes, plants, and certain kinds of outsiders are
also immune to poison, although conceivably special poisons could be concocted
specifically to harm them.</div><div class="table-container"><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 0px none rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 44.1em; padding: 0px;"><tbody><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid"><td colspan="5" valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 51.7em;">Table: Poisons</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 11.2em;">Poison</td><td valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 7.12em;">Type</td><td valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 7.35em;">Initial

can cause creatures and characters to change their shapes—sometimes against
their will, but usually to gain an advantage. Polymorphed creatures retain
their own minds but have new physical forms.</div><div>The
<span style="font-style: italic;">polymorph </span>spell defines the general polymorph effect.</div><div>Since
creatures do not change types, a slaying or bane weapon designed to kill or
harm creatures of a specific type affects those creatures even if they are
polymorphed. Likewise, a creature polymorphed into the form of a creature of a
different type is not subject to slaying and bane effects directed at that type
of creature. </div><div>A
ranger’s favored enemy bonus is based on knowing what the foe is, so if a
creature that is a ranger’s favored enemy polymorphs into another form, the
ranger is denied his bonus.</div><div>A
dwarf ’s bonus for fighting giants is based on shape and size, so he does not
gain a bonus against a giant polymorphed into something else, but does gain the
bonus against any creature polymorphed into a giant.</div><br><h3 id="psionics">PSIONICS</h3><div>Telepathy,
mental combat and psychic powers—psionics is a catchall word that describes
special mental abilities possessed by various creatures. These are spell-like
abilities that a creature generates from the power of its mind alone—no other
outside magical force or ritual is needed. Each psionic creature’s description
contains details on its psionic abilities.</div><div>Psionic
attacks almost always allow Will saving throws to resist them. However, not all
psionic attacks are mental attacks. Some psionic abilities allow the psionic
creature to reshape its own body, heal its wounds, or teleport great distances.
Some psionic creatures can see into the future, the past, and the present (in
far-off locales) as well as read the minds of others. </div><br><h3 id="rays">RAYS</h3><div>All
ray attacks require the attacker to make a successful ranged touch attack
against the target. Rays have varying ranges, which are simple maximums. A ray’s
attack roll never takes a range penalty. Even if a ray hits, it usually allows
the target to make a saving throw (Fortitude or Will). Rays never allow a
Reflex saving throw, but if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC is high, it
might be hard to hit her with the ray in the first place.</div><br><h3 id="regeneration">REGENERATION</h3><div>Creatures
with this extraordinary ability recover from wounds quickly and can even regrow
or reattach severed body parts. Damage dealt to the creature is treated as
nonlethal damage, and the creature automatically cures itself of nonlethal
damage at a fixed rate.</div><div>Certain
attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal damage to the creature normally;
that sort of damage doesn’t convert to nonlethal damage and so doesn’t go away.
The creature’s description includes the details.</div><div>Creatures
with regeneration can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can reattach
severed limbs or body parts. Severed parts die if they are not reattached.</div><div>Regeneration
does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.</div><div>Attack
forms that don’t deal hit point damage ignore regeneration.</div><div>An
attack that can cause instant death only threatens the creature with death if
it is delivered by weapons that deal it lethal damage.</div><br><h3 id="resistance-to-energy">RESISTANCE TO
ENERGY</h3><div>A
creature with resistance to energy has the ability (usually extraordinary) to
ignore some damage of a certain type each round, but it does not have total
immunity. </div><div>Each
resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how many
points of damage are resisted. It doesn’t matter whether the damage has a
mundane or magical source.</div><div>When
resistance completely negates the damage from an energy attack, the attack does
not disrupt a spell. This resistance does not stack with the resistance that a
spellmight provide.</div><br><h3 id="scent">SCENT</h3><div>This
extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out
hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.</div><div>A
creature with the scent ability can detect opponents by sense of smell,
generally within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet. If
it is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting
garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents,
such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at three times these
ranges.</div><div>The
creature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location.
Noting the direction of the scent is a move action. If it moves within 5 feet
of the scent’s source, the creature can pinpoint that source.</div><div>A
creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell,
making a Wisdom check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh
trail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s
odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that
the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the
rules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of
surface conditions and poor visibility.</div><div>Creatures
with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar
sights.</div><div>Water,
particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures.
Water-breathing creatures that have the scent ability, however, can use it in
the water easily.</div><div>False,
powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor
completely spoils the ability to properly detect or identify creatures, and the
base Survival DC to track becomes 20 rather than 10.</div><br><h3 id="spell-resistance">SPELL RESISTANCE</h3><div>Spell
resistance is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by spells.
(Some spells also grant spell resistance.)</div><div>To
affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a caster
level check (1d20 + caster level) at least equal to the creature’s spell
resistance. (The defender’s spell resistance is like an Armor Class against
magical attacks.) If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the
creature. The possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell
resistance. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its spell
resistance to operate.</div><div>Only
spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary
and supernatural abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are
not. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to spell resistance
and some that are not. Even some spells ignore spell resistance; see When Spell
Resistance Applies, below. </div><div>A
creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. Doing so is a standard
action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once a creature lowers
its resistance, it remains down until the creature’s next turn. At the
beginning of the creature’s next turn, the creature’s spell resistance
automatically returns unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (also a
standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity).</div><div>A
creature’s spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, items, or
abilities.</div><div>A
creature with spell resistance cannot impart this power to others by touching
them or standing in their midst. Only the rarest of creatures and a few magic
items have the ability to bestow spell resistance upon another.</div><div>Spell
resistance does not stack. It overlaps. </div><h4 id="when-spell-resistance-applies">When Spell Resistance Applies</h4><div>Each spell
includes an entry that indicates whether spell resistance applies to the spell.
In general, whether spell resistance applies depends on what the spell does:</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Targeted
Spells:</span><span>
Spell resistance applies if the spell is targeted at the creature. Some
individually targeted spells can be directed at several creatures
simultaneously. In such cases, a creature’s spell resistance applies only to
the portion of the spell actually targeted at that creature. If several
different resistant creatures are subjected to such a spell, each checks its
spell resistance separately.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Area
Spells:</span><span>
Spell resistance applies if the resistant creature is within the spell’s area.
It protects the resistant creature without affecting the spell itself.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Effect
Spells:</span><span>
Most effect spells summon or create something and are not subject to spell
resistance. Sometimes, however, spell resistance applies to effect spells,
usually to those that act upon a creature more or less directly, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">web.</span></span></div><div>Spell
resistance can protect a creature from a spell that’s already been cast. Check
spell resistance when the creature is first affected by the spell.</div><div>Check
spell resistance only once for any particular casting of a spell or use of a
spell-like ability. If spell resistance fails the first time, it fails each
time the creature encounters that same casting of the spell. Likewise, if the
spell resistance succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature
has voluntarily lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to a spell,
the creature still has a single chance to resist that spell later, when its
spell resistance is up.</div><div>Spell
resistance has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell
actually goes to work on the resistant creature’s mind or body. If the spell
acts on anything else and the creature is affected as a consequence, no roll is
required. Creatures can be harmed by a spell without being directly affected. </div><div>Spell
resistance does not apply if an effect fools the creature’s senses or reveals
something about the creature.</div><div>Magic
actually has to be working for spell resistance to apply. Spells that have
instantaneous durations but lasting results aren’t subject to spell resistance
unless the resistant creature is exposed to the spell the instant it is cast. </div><div>When
in doubt about whether a spell’s effect is direct or indirect, consider the
spell’s school:</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Abjuration:</span><span> The target creature must
be harmed, changed, or restricted in some manner for spell resistance to apply.
Perception changes aren’t subject to spell resistance.</span></div><div>Abjurations
that block or negate attacks are not subject to an attacker’s spell
resistance—it is the protected creature that is affected by the spell (becoming
immune or resistant to the attack).</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Conjuration:</span><span> These spells are usually
not subject to spell resistance unless the spell conjures some form of energy<span style="font-style: italic;">.
</span>Spells that summon creatures or produce effects that function like
creatures are not subject to spell resistance.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Divination:</span><span> These spells do not
affect creatures directly and are not subject to spell resistance, even though
what they reveal about a creature might be very damaging.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Enchantment:</span><span> Since enchantment spells
affect creatures’ minds, they are typically subject to spell resistance.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Evocation:</span><span> If an evocation spell
deals damage to the creature, it has a direct effect. If the spell damages
something else, it has an indirect effect.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Illusion:
</span><span>These
spells are almost never subject to spell resistance. Illusions that entail a
direct attack are exceptions.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Necromancy:</span><span> Most of these spells
alter the target creature’s life force and are subject to spell resistance.
Unusual necromancy spells that don’t affect other creatures directly are not
subject to spell resistance.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Transmutation:</span><span> These spells are subject
to spell resistance if they transform the target creature. Transmutation spells
are not subject to spell resistance if they are targeted on a point in space
instead of on a creature. Some transmutations make objects harmful (or more
harmful), such as <span style="font-style: italic;">magic stone</span>. Even these spells are not generally
subject to spell resistance because they affect the objects, not the creatures
against which the objects are used. Spell resistance works against <span style="font-style: italic;">magic
stone </span>only if the creature with spell resistance is holding the stones when
the cleric casts <span style="font-style: italic;">magic stone </span>on them. </span></div><h4 id="successful-spell-resistance">Successful Spell Resistance</h4><div>Spell
resistance prevents a spell or a spell-like ability from affecting or harming
the resistant creature, but it never removes a magical effect from another
creature or negates a spell’s effect on another creature. Spell resistance
prevents a spell from disrupting another spell.</div><div>Against
an ongoing spell that has already been cast, a failed check against spell
resistance allows the resistant creature to ignore any effect the spell might
have. The magic continues to affect others normally.</div><br><h3 id="tremorsense">TREMORSENSE</h3><div>A
creature with tremorsense automatically senses the location of anything that is
in contact with the ground and within range.</div><div>If
no straight path exists through the ground from the creature to those that it’s
sensing, then the range defines the maximum distance of the shortest indirect
path. It must itself be in contact with the ground, and the creatures must be
moving. </div><div>As
long as the other creatures are taking physical actions, including casting
spells with somatic components, they’re considered moving; they don’t have to
move from place to place for a creature with tremorsense to detect them.</div><br><h3 id="turn-resistance">TURN RESISTANCE</h3><div>Some
creatures (usually undead) are less easily affected by the turning ability of
clerics or paladins.</div><div>Turn
resistance is an extraordinary ability.</div><div>When
resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, added the appropriate
bonus to the creature’s Hit Dice total. </div><br><h2 id="conditions">CONDITIONS</h2><div>If
more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects
can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ability
Damaged:</span><span>
The character has temporarily lost 1 or more ability score points. Lost points
return at a rate of 1 per day unless noted otherwise by the condition dealing
the damage. A character with Strength 0 falls to the ground and is helpless. A
character with Dexterity 0 is paralyzed. A character with Constitution 0 is
dead. A character with Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is unconscious.
Ability damage is different from penalties to ability scores, which go away
when the conditions causing them go away.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ability
Drained:</span><span>
The character has permanently lost 1 or more ability score points. The
character can regain these points only through magical means. A character with
Strength 0 falls to the ground and is helpless. A character with Dexterity 0 is
paralyzed. A character with Constitution 0 is dead. A character with
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is unconscious. </span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Blinded:</span><span> The character cannot see.
He takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class, loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any),
moves at half speed, and takes a –4 penalty on Search checks and on most
Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks. All checks and activities that rely
on vision (such as reading and Spot checks) automatically fail. All opponents
are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) to the blinded
character. Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to
these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Blown
Away:</span><span>
Depending on its size, a creature can be blown away by winds of high velocity. A
creature on the ground that is blown away is knocked down and rolls 1d4 x 10
feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. A flying creature that
is blown away is blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal
damage due to battering and buffering. </span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Checked:</span><span> Prevented from achieving
forward motion by an applied force, such as wind. Checked creatures on the
ground merely stop. Checked flying creatures move back a distance specified in
the description of the effect.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700;">Confused:</span><span>A <span style="font-style: italic;">confused </span>character’s
actions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn: 01–10,
attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attacking
is not possible); 11–20, act normally; 21–50, do nothing but babble
incoherently; 51–70, flee away from caster at top possible speed; 71–100,
attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the
subject’s self ). A <span style="font-style: italic;">confused </span>character who can’t carry out the indicated
action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special
advantage when attacking a <span style="font-style: italic;">confused </span>character. Any <span style="font-style: italic;">confused </span>character
who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long
as it is still <span style="font-style: italic;">confused </span>when its turn comes. A <span style="font-style: italic;">confused </span>character
does not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not
already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or
because it has just been attacked).</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Cowering:
</span><span>The
character is frozen in fear and can take no actions. A cowering character takes
a –2 penalty to Armor Class and loses her Dexterity bonus (if any).</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Dazed:</span><span> The creature is unable to
act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to AC.</span></div><div>A
dazed condition typically lasts 1 round.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Dazzled:</span><span> The creature is unable to
see well because of overstimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a –1
penalty on attack rolls, Search checks, and Spot checks.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Dead:
</span><span>The
character’s hit points are reduced to –10, his Constitution drops to 0, or he
is killed outright by a spell or effect. The character’s soul leaves his body.
Dead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be
restored to life via magic. A dead body decays normally unless magically
preserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the
body either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending
on the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need not worry
about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead
bodies.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Deafened:</span><span> A deafened character
cannot hear. She takes a –4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails
Listen checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with
verbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow
accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Disabled:</span><span> A character with 0 hit
points, or one who has negative hit points but has become stable and conscious,
is disabled. A disabled character may take a single move action or standard
action each round (but not both, nor can she take full-round actions). She
moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn’t risk further injury, but
performing any standard action (or any other action the DM deems strenuous,
including some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) deals 1 point of
damage after the completion of the act. Unless the action increased the
disabled character’s hit points, she is now in negative hit points and dying.</span></div><div>A
disabled character with negative hit points recovers hit points naturally if
she is being helped. Otherwise, each day she has a 10% chance to start
recovering hit points naturally (starting with that day); otherwise, she loses
1 hit point. Once an unaided character starts recovering hit points naturally,
she is no longer in danger of losing hit points (even if her current hit points
are negative).</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Dying:</span><span> A dying character is
unconscious and near death. She has –1 to –9 current hit points. A dying
character can take no actions and is unconscious. At the end of each round
(starting with the round in which the character dropped below 0 hit points),
the character rolls d% to see whether she becomes stable. She has a 10% chance
to become stable. If she does not, she loses 1 hit point. If a dying character
reaches –10 hit points, she is dead.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Energy
Drained:</span><span>
The character gains one or more negative levels, which might permanently drain
the character’s levels. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as
Hit Dice, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature the following
penalties: –1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability
checks; loss of 5 hit points; and –1 to effective level (for determining the
power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). In
addition, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from the highest spell
level castable.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Entangled:</span><span> The character is
ensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it
unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing
force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and
takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity. An
entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration
check (DC 15 + the spell’s level) or lose the spell. </span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Exhausted:</span><span> An exhausted character
moves at half speed and takes a –6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1
hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued
character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause
fatigue.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fascinated:
</span><span>A
fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The
creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention
to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a –4
penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any
potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated
creature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat,
such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at
the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated
creature’s ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action. </span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fatigued:</span><span> A fatigued character can
neither run nor charge and takes a –2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing
anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to
become exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no
longer fatigued. </span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Flat-Footed:</span><span> A character who has not
yet acted during a combat is flat-footed, not yet reacting normally to the
situation. A flat-footed character loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) and
cannot make attacks of opportunity. </span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Frightened:</span><span> A frightened creature
flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may
fight. A frightened creature takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving
throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special
abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means
if they are the only way to escape. </span></div><div>Frightened
is like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a
more extreme state of fear.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Grappling:</span><span> Engaged in wrestling or
some other form of hand-to-hand struggle with one or more attackers. A
grappling character can undertake only a limited number of actions. He does not
threaten any squares, and loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) against
opponents he isn’t grappling.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Helpless:</span><span> A helpless character is
paralyzed, <span style="font-style: italic;">held</span>, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely
at an opponent’s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a Dexterity of 0
(–5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus
(equivalent to attacking a prone target). Ranged attacks gets no special bonus
against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets. </span></div><div>As
a full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace
to a helpless foe. An enemy can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is
adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a critical
hit. (A rogue also gets her sneak attack damage bonus against a helpless foe
when delivering a coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a
Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. </div><div>Delivering
a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity. </div><div>Creatures
that are immune to critical hits do not take critical damage, nor do they need
to make Fortitude saves to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Incorporeal:
</span><span>Having no
physical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all nonmagical attack forms.
They can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic
weapons, spells, spell-like effects, or supernatural effects. </span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Invisible:</span><span> Visually undetectable. An
invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against sighted opponents,
and ignores its opponents’ Dexterity bonuses to AC (if any). (See Invisibility,
under Special Abilities.)</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Knocked
Down:</span><span>
Depending on their size, creatures can be knocked down by winds of high
velocity. Creatures on the ground are knocked prone by the force of the wind.
Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6 x 10 feet.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Nauseated:</span><span> Experiencing stomach
distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on
spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a
character can take is a single move action per turn.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Panicked:
</span><span>A
panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the
source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random
path. It can’t take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a –2
penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked
creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the total defense action
in combat. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to
flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to
escape.</span></div><div>Panicked
is a more extreme state of fear than shaken or frightened.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Paralyzed:</span><span> A paralyzed character is
frozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has effective
Dexterity and Strength scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions.
A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed
cannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown.
A creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature—ally or
not. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2
squares.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Petrified:</span><span> A petrified character has
been turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified character
cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns
to flesh, he is unharmed. If the character’s petrified body is incomplete when
it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount
of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Pinned:</span><span> Held immobile (but not
helpless) in a grapple.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prone:</span><span> The character is on the
ground. An attacker who is prone has a –4 penalty on melee attack rolls and
cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A defender who is prone
gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks, but takes a –4 penalty
to AC against melee attacks.</span></div><div>Standing
up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Shaken:
</span><span>A shaken
character takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and
ability checks.</span></div><div>Shaken
is a less severe state of fear than frightened or panicked.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Sickened:</span><span> The character takes a –2
penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks,
and ability checks.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stable:</span><span> A character who was dying
but who has stopped losing hit points and still has negative hit points is
stable. The character is no longer dying, but is still unconscious. If the
character has become stable because of aid from another character (such as a
Heal check or magical healing), then the character no longer loses hit points.
He has a 10% chance each hour of becoming conscious and disabled (even though
his hit points are still negative). </span></div><div>If
the character became stable on his own and hasn’t had help, he is still at risk
of losing hit points. Each hour, he has a 10% chance of becoming conscious and
disabled. Otherwise he loses 1 hit point.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Staggered:</span><span> A character whose
nonlethal damage exactly equals his current hit points is staggered. A
staggered character may take a single move action or standard action each round
(but not both, nor can she take full-round actions).</span></div><div>A
character whose current hit points exceed his nonlethal damage is no longer
staggered; a character whose nonlethal damage exceeds his hit points becomes
unconscious.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stunned:
</span><span>A stunned
creature drops everything held, can’t take actions, takes a –2 penalty to AC,
and loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Turned:</span><span> Affected by a turn undead
attempt. Turned undead flee for 10 rounds (1 minute) by the best and fastest
means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Unconscious:
</span><span>Knocked
out and helpless. Unconsciousness can result from having current hit points
between –1 and –9, or from nonlethal damage in excess of current hit points.</span></div><br><br></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"html":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\u003chead\u003e\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eTRAPS\u003c/title\u003e\u003cstyle\u003etable, table * { border-collapse: collapse } body { font: 13.3333px \"Times New Roman\", serif; }\u003c/style\u003e\u003c/head\u003e\n\n\u003cbody lang=\"KO\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis material is Open\nGame Content, and is licensed for public use under the terms of the Open Game\nLicense v1.0a.\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch1 id=\"special-abilities-conditions\"\u003eSPECIAL\nABILITIES \u0026amp; CONDITIONS\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"special-abilities\"\u003eSPECIAL ABILITIES\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eA\nspecial ability is either extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural in nature.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 700;\"\u003eExtraordinary\nAbilities (Ex):\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\nExtraordinary abilities are nonmagical.
