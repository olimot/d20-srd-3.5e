Combat\nfollows this sequence:</div><div>1.\nEach combatant starts out flat-footed. Once a combatant acts, he or she is no\nlonger flat-footed.</div><div>2.\nDetermine which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of the\nbattle. If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a\nsurprise round happens before regular rounds of combat begin. The combatants\nwho are aware of the opponents can act in the surprise round, so they roll for\ninitiative. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the\nbattle aware of their opponents each take one action (either a standard action\nor a move action) during the surprise round. Combatants who were unaware do not\nget to act in the surprise round. If no one or everyone starts the battle\naware, there is no surprise round.</div><div>3.\nCombatants who have not yet rolled initiative do so. All combatants are now\nready to begin their first regular round of combat.</div><div>4.\nCombatants act in initiative order (highest to lowest).</div><div>5.\nWhen everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest initiative acts\nagain, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat ends.</div><br><h2 id=\"combat-statistics\">COMBAT\nSTATISTICS</h2><div>This\nsection summarizes the statistics that determine success in combat, and then\ndetails how to use</div><br><h3 id=\"attack-roll\">ATTACK ROLL</h3><div>An\nattack roll represents your attempt to strike your opponent on your turn in a\nround.

The type of weapon used determines the\namount of damage you deal. Effects that modify weapon damage apply to unarmed\nstrikes and the natural physical attack forms of creatures.</div><div>Damage\nreduces a target’s current hit points.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Minimum\nDamage:</span><span>\nIf penalties reduce the damage result to less than 1, a hit still deals 1 point\nof damage.</span></div><div>Strength\nBonus: When you hit with a melee or thrown weapon, including a sling, add your\nStrength modifier to the damage result. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus,\napplies on attacks made with a bow that is not a composite bow.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Off-Hand\nWeapon: </span><span>When\nyou deal damage with a weapon in your off hand, you add only 1/2 your Strength\nbonus.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Wielding\na Weapon Two-Handed: </span><span>When you deal damage with a weapon that you are wielding\ntwo-handed, you add 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. However, you don’t get\nthis higher Strength bonus when using a light weapon with two hands.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Multiplying\nDamage:</span><span>\nSometimes you multiply damage by some factor, such as on a critical hit. Roll\nthe damage (with all modifiers) multiple times and total the results. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Note: </span>When\nyou multiply damage more than once, each multiplier works off the original,\nunmultiplied damage.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Exception:\n</span><span>Extra\ndamage dice over and above a weapon’s normal damage are never multiplied.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Ability\nDamage:</span><span>\nCertain creatures and magical effects can cause temporary ability damage (a\nreduction to an ability score).</span></div><br><h3 id=\"armor-class\">ARMOR CLASS</h3><div>Your\nArmor Class (AC) represents how hard it is for opponents to land a solid,\ndamaging blow on you. It’s the attack roll result that an opponent needs to\nachieve to hit you. Your AC is equal to the following: 10 + armor bonus +\nshield bonus + Dexterity modifier + size modifier</div><br><div>Note\nthat armor limits your Dexterity bonus, so if you’re wearing armor, you might\nnot be able to apply your whole Dexterity bonus to your AC.</div><div>Sometimes\nyou can’t use your Dexterity bonus (if you have one). If you can’t react to a\nblow, you can’t use your Dexterity bonus to AC. (If you don’t have a Dexterity\nbonus, nothing happens.)</div><br><div>Other\nModifiers: Many other factors modify your AC.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Enhancement\nBonuses: </span><span>Enhancement\neffects make your armor better.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Deflection\nBonus: </span><span>Magical\ndeflection effects ward off attacks and improve your AC.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Natural\nArmor: </span><span>Natural\narmor improves your AC.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dodge\nBonuses: </span><span>Some\nother AC bonuses represent actively avoiding blows. These bonuses are called\ndodge bonuses. Any situation that denies you your Dexterity bonus also denies\nyou dodge bonuses. (Wearing armor, however, does not limit these bonuses the\nway it limits a Dexterity bonus to AC.) Unlike most sorts of bonuses, dodge\nbonuses stack with each other.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Touch\nAttacks:</span><span>\nSome attacks disregard armor, including shields and natural armor. In these\ncases, the attacker makes a touch attack roll (either ranged or melee). When\nyou are the target of a touch attack, your AC doesn’t include any armor bonus,\nshield bonus, or natural armor bonus. All other modifiers, such as your size\nmodifier, Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) apply normally.</span></div><br><h3 id=\"hit-points\">HIT POINTS</h3><div>When\nyour hit point total reaches 0, you’re disabled. When it reaches –1, you’re\ndying. When it gets to –10, you’re dead.</div><br><h3 id=\"speed\">SPEED</h3><div>Your\nspeed tells you how far you can move in a round and still do something, such as\nattack or cast a spell. Your speed depends mostly on your race and what armor\nyou’re wearing.</div><div>Dwarves,\ngnomes, and halflings have a speed of 20 feet (4 squares), or 15 feet (3\nsquares) when wearing medium or heavy armor (except for dwarves, who move 20\nfeet in any armor).</div><div>Humans,\nelves, half-elves, and half-orcs have a speed of 30 feet (6 squares), or 20\nfeet (4 squares) in medium or heavy armor.</div><div>If\nyou use two move actions in a round (sometimes called a “double move” action),\nyou can move up to double your speed. If you spend the entire round to run all\nout, you can move up to quadruple your speed (or triple if you are in heavy\narmor).</div><br><h3 id=\"saving-throws\">SAVING THROWS</h3><div>Generally,\nwhen you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to\navoid or reduce the effect. Like an attack roll, a saving throw is a d20 roll\nplus a bonus based on your class, level, and an ability score. Your saving\nthrow modifier is: Base save bonus + ability modifier </div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Saving\nThrow Types:</span><span>\nThe three different kinds of saving throws are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will:</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fortitude:\n</span><span>These\nsaves measure your ability to stand up to physical punishment or attacks\nagainst your vitality and health. Apply your Constitution modifier to your\nFortitude saving throws. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Reflex:\n</span><span>These\nsaves test your ability to dodge area attacks. Apply your Dexterity modifier to\nyour Reflex saving throws. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Will:\n</span><span>These\nsaves reflect your resistance to mental influence as well as many magical\neffects. Apply your Wisdom modifier to your Will saving throws.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Saving\nThrow Difficulty Class:</span><span> The DC for a save is determined by the attack itself.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Automatic\nFailures and Successes:</span><span> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always\na failure (and may cause damage to exposed items; see Items Surviving after a\nSaving Throw). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.</span></div><br><h2 id=\"initiative\">INITIATIVE</h2><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Initiative\nChecks:</span><span>\nAt the start of a battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. An\ninitiative check is a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or her\nDexterity modifier to the roll. Characters act in order, counting down from\nhighest result to lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in\nthe same order (unless a character takes an action that results in his or her\ninitiative changing; see Special Initiative Actions).</span></div><div>If\ntwo or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the combatants\nwho are tied act in order of total initiative modifier (highest first). If\nthere is still a tie, the tied characters should roll again to determine which\none of them goes before the other.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Flat-Footed:</span><span> At the start of a battle,\nbefore you have had a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular\nturn in the initiative order), you are flat-footed. You can’t use your\nDexterity bonus to AC (if any) while flat-footed. Barbarians and rogues have\nthe uncanny dodge extraordinary ability, which allows them to avoid losing\ntheir Dexterity bonus to AC due to being flat-footed.</span></div><div>A\nflat-footed character can’t make attacks of opportunity.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Inaction:</span><span> Even if you can’t take\nactions, you retain your initiative score for the duration of the encounter.</span></div><br><h3 id=\"surprise\">SURPRISE</h3><div>When\na combat starts, if you are not aware of your opponents and they are aware of\nyou, you’re surprised.</div><br><div>Determining\nAwareness</div><div>Sometimes\nall the combatants on a side are aware of their opponents, sometimes none are,\nand sometimes only some of them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side\nare aware and the other combatants on each side are unaware.</div><div>Determining\nawareness may call for Listen checks, Spot checks, or other checks.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">The\nSurprise Round:</span><span>\nIf some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise\nround happens before regular rounds begin. Any combatants aware of the\nopponents can act in the surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In\ninitiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware\nof their opponents each take a standard action during the surprise round. You\ncan also take free actions during the surprise round. If no one or everyone is\nsurprised, no surprise round occurs.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Unaware\nCombatants:</span><span>\nCombatants who are unaware at the start of battle don’t get to act in the\nsurprise round. Unaware combatants are flat-footed because they have not acted\nyet, so they lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</span></div><br><h2 id=\"attacks-of-opportunity\">ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY</h2><div>Sometimes\na combatant in a melee lets her guard down. In this case, combatants near her\ncan take advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free\nattacks are called attacks of opportunity.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Threatened\nSquares:</span><span>\nYou threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even when it\nis not your action. Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to\nyour space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in\na threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you’re\nunarmed, you don’t normally threaten any squares and thus can’t make attacks of\nopportunity.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Reach\nWeapons: </span><span>Most\ncreatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means\nthat they can make melee attacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square)\naway. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding reach weapons threaten more\nsquares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium\nhave a natural reach of 10 feet or more.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Provoking\nan Attack of Opportunity: </span><span>Two kinds of actions can provoke attacks of opportunity:\nmoving out of a threatened square and performing an action within a threatened\nsquare.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Moving:\n</span><span>Moving\nout of a threatened square usually provokes an attack of opportunity from the\nthreatening opponent. There are two common methods of avoiding such an\nattack—the 5-foot-step and the withdraw action (see below).</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Performing\na Distracting Act: </span><span>Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke\nattacks of opportunity as you divert your attention from the battle. Table:\nActions in Combat notes many of the actions that provoke attacks of\nopportunity.</span></div><div>Remember\nthat even actions that normally provoke attacks of opportunity may have\nexceptions to this rule.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Making\nan Attack of Opportunity:</span><span> An attack of opportunity is a single melee attack, and you\ncan only make one per round. You don’t have to make an attack of opportunity if\nyou don’t want to.</span></div><div>An\nexperienced character gets additional regular melee attacks (by using the full\nattack action), but at a lower attack bonus. You make your attack of\nopportunity, however, at your normal attack bonus—even if you’ve already\nattacked in the round.</div><div>An\nattack of opportunity “interrupts” the normal flow of actions in the round. If\nan attack of opportunity is provoked, immediately resolve the attack of\nopportunity, then continue with the next character’s turn (or complete the\ncurrent turn, if the attack of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a\ncharacter’s turn).</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Combat\nReflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity: </span><span>If you have the Combat Reflexes feat\nyou can add your Dexterity modifier to the number of attacks of opportunity you\ncan make in a round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a\ngiven opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of opportunity\nfrom you, you could make two separate attacks of opportunity (since each one\nrepresents a different opportunity). Moving out of more than one square\nthreatened by the same opponent in the same round doesn’t count as more than\none opportunity for that opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal\nattack bonus.</span></div><br><h2 id=\"actions-in-combat\">ACTIONS\nIN COMBAT</h2><br><h3 id=\"the-combat-round\">THE COMBAT ROUND</h3><div>Each\nround represents 6 seconds in the game world. A round presents an opportunity\nfor each character involved in a combat situation to take an action. </div><div>Each\nround’s activity begins with the character with the highest initiative result\nand then proceeds, in order, from there. Each round of a combat uses the same\ninitiative order. When a character’s turn comes up in the initiative sequence,\nthat character performs his entire round’s worth of actions. (For exceptions,\nsee Attacks of Opportunity and Special Initiative Actions.)</div><div>For\nalmost all purposes, there is no relevance to the end of a round or the\nbeginning of a round. A round can be a segment of game time starting with the\nfirst character to act and ending with the last, but it usually means a span of\ntime from one round to the same initiative count in the next round. Effects\nthat last a certain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count\nthat they began on.</div><br><h3 id=\"action-types\">ACTION TYPES</h3><div>An\naction’s type essentially tells you how long the action takes to perform (within\nthe framework of the 6-second combat round) and how movement is treated. There\nare four types of actions: standard actions, move actions, full-round actions,\nand free actions.</div><div>In\na normal round, you can perform a standard action and a move action, or you can\nperform a full-round action. You can also perform one or more free actions. You\ncan always take a move action in place of a standard action.</div><div>In\nsome situations (such as in a surprise round), you may be limited to taking\nonly a single move action or standard action.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Standard\nAction:</span><span> A\nstandard action allows you to do something, most commonly make an attack or\ncast a spell. See Table: Actions in Combat for other standard actions.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Move\nAction:</span><span> A\nmove action allows you to move your speed or perform an action that takes a\nsimilar amount of time. See Table: Actions in Combat.</span></div><div>You\ncan take a move action in place of a standard action. If you move no actual\ndistance in a round (commonly because you have swapped your move for one or\nmore equivalent actions), you can take one 5-foot step either before, during,\nor after the action.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Full-Round\nAction:</span><span> A\nfull-round action consumes all your effort during a round. The only movement\nyou can take during a full-round action is a 5-foot step before, during, or\nafter the action. You can also perform free actions (see below).</span></div><div>Some\nfull-round actions do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.</div><div>Some\nfull-round actions can be taken as standard actions, but only in situations\nwhen you are limited to performing only a standard action during your round.\nThe descriptions of specific actions, below, detail which actions allow this\noption.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Free\nAction:</span><span>\nFree actions consume a very small amount of time and effort. You can perform\none or more free actions while taking another action normally. However, there\nare reasonable limits on what you can really do for free.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Not\nan Action:</span><span>\nSome activities are so minor that they are not even considered free actions.\nThey literally don’t take any time at all to do and are considered an inherent\npart of doing something else.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Restricted\nActivity:</span><span>\nIn some situations, you may be unable to take a full round’s worth of actions.\nIn such cases, you are restricted to taking only a single standard action or a\nsingle move action (plus free actions as normal). You can’t take a full-round\naction (though you can start or complete a full-round action by using a\nstandard action; see below).</span></div><br><div class=\"table-container\"><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

(Opponents\nwithin 5 feet are considered adjacent to you.) Some melee weapons have reach,\nas indicated in their descriptions. With a typical reach weapon, you can strike\nopponents 10 feet away, but you can’t strike adjacent foes (those within 5\nfeet).</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Unarmed\nAttacks:</span><span>\nStriking for damage with punches, kicks, and head butts is much like attacking\nwith a melee weapon, except for the following:</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Attacks\nof Opportunity: </span><span>Attacking\nunarmed provokes an attack of opportunity from the character you attack,\nprovided she is armed. The attack of opportunity comes before your attack. An\nunarmed attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity from other foes nor does\nit provoke an attack of opportunity from an unarmed foe.</span></div><div>An\nunarmed character can’t take attacks of opportunity (but see “Armed” Unarmed\nAttacks, below).</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Armed”\nUnarmed Attacks: </span><span>Sometimes a character’s or creature’s unarmed attack counts\nas an armed attack. A monk, a character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat,\na spellcaster delivering a touch attack spell, and a creature with natural\nphysical weapons all count as being armed.</span></div><div>Note\nthat being armed counts for both offense and defense (the character can make\nattacks of opportunity)</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Unarmed\nStrike Damage: </span><span>An\nunarmed strike from a Medium character deals 1d3 points of damage (plus your\nStrength modifier, as normal). A Small character’s unarmed strike deals 1d2\npoints of damage, while a Large character’s unarmed strike deals 1d4 points of\ndamage. All damage from unarmed strikes is nonlethal damage. Unarmed strikes\ncount as light weapons (for purposes of two-weapon attack penalties and so on).</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dealing\nLethal Damage: </span><span>You\ncan specify that your unarmed strike will deal lethal damage before you make\nyour attack roll, but you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll. If you have\nthe Improved Unarmed Strike feat, you can deal lethal damage with an unarmed\nstrike without taking a penalty on the attack roll.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Ranged\nAttacks:</span><span>\nWith a ranged weapon, you can shoot or throw at any target that is within the\nweapon’s maximum range and in line of sight. The maximum range for a thrown\nweapon is five range increments. For projectile weapons, it is ten range\nincrements. Some ranged weapons have shorter maximum ranges, as specified in\ntheir descriptions.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Attack\nRolls:</span><span> An\nattack roll represents your attempts to strike your opponent. </span></div><div>Your\nattack roll is 1d20 + your attack bonus with the weapon you’re using. If the\nresult is at least as high as the target’s AC, you hit and deal damage.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Automatic\nMisses and Hits:</span><span>\nA natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on the attack roll is always a miss. A natural\n20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat—a\npossible critical hit.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Damage\nRolls:</span><span> If\nthe attack roll result equals or exceeds the target’s AC, the attack hits and\nyou deal damage. Roll the appropriate damage for your weapon. Damage is\ndeducted from the target’s current hit points.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Multiple\nAttacks:</span><span>\nA character who can make more than one attack per round must use the full\nattack action (see Full-Round Actions, below) in order to get more than one\nattack.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Shooting\nor Throwing into a Melee:</span><span> If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in\nmelee with a friendly character, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll. Two\ncharacters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and either\nthreatens the other. (An unconscious or otherwise immobilized character is not\nconsidered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.)</span></div><div>If\nyour target (or the part of your target you’re aiming at, if it’s a big target)\nis at least 10 feet away from the nearest friendly character, you can avoid the\n–4 penalty, even if the creature you’re aiming at is engaged in melee with a\nfriendly character.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Precise\nShot: </span><span>If\nyou have the Precise Shot feat you don’t take this penalty.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Fighting\nDefensively as a Standard Action:</span><span> You can choose to fight defensively when attacking.\nIf you do so, you take a –4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2\ndodge bonus to AC for the same round.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Critical\nHits:</span><span>\nWhen you make an attack roll and get a natural 20 (the d20 shows 20), you hit\nregardless of your target’s Armor Class, and you have scored a threat. The hit\nmight be a critical hit (or “crit”). To find out if it’s a critical hit, you\nimmediately make a critical roll—another attack roll with all the same\nmodifiers as the attack roll you just made. If the critical roll also results\nin a hit against the target’s AC, your original hit is a critical hit. (The\ncritical roll just needs to hit to give you a crit. It doesn’t need to come up\n20 again.) If the critical roll is a miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.</span></div><div>A critical hit\nmeans that you roll your damage more than once, with all your usual bonuses,\nand add the rolls together. Unless otherwise specified, the threat range for a\ncritical hit on an attack roll is 20, and the multiplier is x2.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Exception:</span><span>Extra damage over and\nabove a weapon’s normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Increased\nThreat Range:</span><span>Sometimes\nyour threat range is greater than 20. That is, you can score a threat on a\nlower number. In such cases, a roll of lower than 20 is not an automatic hit.\nAny attack roll that doesn’t result in a hit is not a threat.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Increased\nCritical Multiplier:</span><span>Some weapons deal better than double damage on a critical\nhit.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Spells\nand Critical Hits: </span><span>A spell that requires an attack rollcan score a\ncritical hit. A spell attack that requires no attack rollcannot score a\ncritical hit.</span></div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Cast a Spell</div><div>Most\nspells require 1 standard action to cast. You can cast such a spell either\nbefore or after you take a move action. </div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Note:\n</span><span>You\nretain your Dexterity bonus to AC while casting.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nComponents:</span><span>\nTo cast a spell with a verbal (V) component, your character must speak in a\nfirm voice. If you’re gagged or in the area of a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">silence </span>spell, you\ncan’t cast such a spell. A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance\nto spoil any spell he tries to cast if that spell has a verbal component.</span></div><div>To\ncast a spell with a somatic (S) component, you must gesture freely with at\nleast one hand. You can’t cast a spell of this type while bound, grappling, or\nwith both your hands full or occupied.</div><div>To\ncast a spell with a material (M), focus (F), or divine focus (DF) component,\nyou have to have the proper materials, as described by the spell. Unless these\nmaterials are elaboratepreparing these materials is a free action. For\nmaterial components and focuses whose costs are not listed, you can assume that\nyou have them if you have your spell component pouch.</div><div>Some spells have\nan experience point (XP) component and entail an experience point cost to you.\nNo spell can restore the lost XP. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a\nlevel, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough XP to spare.\nHowever, you may, on gaining enough XP to achieve a new level, immediately\nspend the XP on casting the spell rather than keeping it to advance a level.\nThe XP are expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the casting\nsucceeds.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Concentration:</span><span> You must concentrate to\ncast a spell. If you can’t concentrate you can’t cast a spell. If you start\ncasting a spell but something interferes with your concentration you must make\na Concentration check or lose the spell. The check’s DC depends on what is\nthreatening your concentration (see the Concentration skill). If you fail, the\nspell fizzles with no effect. If you prepare spells, it is lost from\npreparation. If you cast at will, it counts against your daily limit of spells\neven though you did not cast it successfully.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Concentrating\nto Maintain a Spell:</span><span> Some spells require continued concentration to keep them\ngoing. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that doesn’t\nprovoke an attack of opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration\nwhen casting a spell can keep you from concentrating to maintain a spell. If\nyour concentration breaks, the spell ends.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Casting\nTime:</span><span>\nMost spells have a casting time of 1 standard action. A spell cast in this\nmanner immediately takes effect.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Attacks\nof Opportunity:</span><span>\nGenerally, if you cast a spell, you provoke attacks of opportunity from\nthreatening enemies. If you take damage from an attack of opportunity, you must\nmake a Concentration check (DC 10 + points of damage taken + spell level) or\nlose the spell. Spells that require only a free action to cast don’t provoke\nattacks of opportunity.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Casting\non the Defensive:</span><span> Casting a spell while on the defensive does not provoke an\nattack of opportunity. It does, however, require a Concentration check (DC 15 +\nspell level) to pull off. Failure means that you lose the spell.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Touch\nSpells in Combat:</span><span> Many spells have a range of touch. To use these spells, you\ncast the spell and then touch the subject, either in the same round or any time\nlater. In the same round that you cast the spell, you may also touch (or\nattempt to touch) the target. You may take your move before casting the spell,\nafter touching the target, or between casting the spell and touching the\ntarget. You can automatically touch one friend or use the spell on yourself,\nbut to touch an opponent, you must succeed on an attack roll.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Touch\nAttacks: </span><span>Touching\nan opponent with a touch spell is considered to be an armed attack and\ntherefore does not provoke attacks of opportunity. However, the act of casting\na spell does provoke an attack of opportunity. Touch attacks come in two types:\nmelee touch attacks and ranged touch attacks. You can score critical hits with\neither type of attack. Your opponent’s AC against a touch attack does not\ninclude any armor bonus, shield bonus, or natural armor bonus. His size\nmodifier, Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) all apply normally.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Holding\nthe Charge: </span><span>If\nyou don’t discharge the spell in the round when you cast the spell, you can\nhold the discharge of the spell (hold the charge) indefinitely. You can\ncontinue to make touch attacks round after round. You can touch one friend as a\nstandard action or up to six friends as a full-round action. If you touch\nanything or anyone while holding a charge, even unintentionally, the spell\ndischarges. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.\nAlternatively, you may make a normal unarmed attack (or an attack with a\nnatural weapon) while holding a charge. In this case, you aren’t considered\narmed and you provoke attacks of opportunity as normal for the attack. (If your\nunarmed attack or natural weapon attack doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity,\nneither does this attack.) If the attack hits, you deal normal damage for your\nunarmed attack or natural weapon and the spell discharges. If the attack\nmisses, you are still holding the charge.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Dismiss\na Spell:</span><span>\nDismissing an active spell is a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of\nopportunity.</span></div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Activate Magic Item</div><div>Many\nmagic items don’t need to be activated. However, certain magic items need to be\nactivated, especially potions, scrolls, wands, rods, and staffs. Activating a\nmagic item is a standard action (unless the item description indicates\notherwise).</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nCompletion Items: </span><span>Activating a spell completion item is the equivalent of\ncasting a spell. It requires concentration and provokes attacks of opportunity.\nYou lose the spell if your concentration is broken, and you can attempt to\nactivate the item while on the defensive, as with casting a spell.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell\nTrigger, Command Word, or Use-Activated Items: </span><span>Activating any of these kinds of\nitems does not require concentration and does not provoke attacks of\nopportunity.</span></div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Use Special Ability</div><div>Using\na special ability is usually a standard action, but whether it is a standard\naction, a full-round action, or not an action at all is defined by the ability.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Spell-Like\nAbilities:</span><span>\nUsing a spell-like ability works like casting a spell in that it requires\nconcentration and provokes attacks of opportunity. Spell-like abilities can be\ndisrupted. If your concentration is broken, the attempt to use the ability\nfails, but the attempt counts as if you had used the ability. The casting time\nof a spell-like ability is 1 standard action, unless the ability description\nnotes otherwise.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Using\na Spell-Like Ability on the Defensive: </span><span>You may attempt to use a spell-like\nability on the defensive, just as with casting a spell. If the Concentration\ncheck (DC 15 + spell level) fails, you can’t use the ability, but the attempt\ncounts as if you had used the ability.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Supernatural\nAbilities:</span><span>\nUsing a supernatural ability is usually a standard action (unless defined\notherwise by the ability’s description). Its use cannot be disrupted, does not\nrequire concentration, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Extraordinary\nAbilities:</span><span>\nUsing an extraordinary ability is usually not an action because most\nextraordinary abilities automatically happen in a reactive fashion. Those\nextraordinary abilities that are actions are usually standard actions that\ncannot be disrupted, do not require concentration, and do not provoke attacks\nof opportunity.</span></div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Total Defense</div><div>You\ncan defend yourself as a standard action. You get a +4 dodge bonus to your AC\nfor 1 round. Your AC improves at the start of this action. You can’t combine\ntotal defense with fighting defensively or with the benefit of the Combat\nExpertise feat (since both of those require you to declare an attack or full\nattack). You can’t make attacks of opportunity while using total defense.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Start/Complete Full-Round Action</div><div>The\n“start full-round action” standard action lets you start undertaking a\nfull-round action, which you can complete in the following round by using\nanother standard action. You can’t use this action to start or complete a full\nattack, charge, run, or withdraw.</div><br><h3 id=\"move-actions\">MOVE ACTIONS</h3><div>With\nthe exception of specific movement-related skills, most move actions don’t\nrequire a check.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Move</div><div>The simplest\nmove action is moving your speed. If you take this kind of move action during\nyour turn, you can’t also take a 5-foot step.</div><div>Many\nnonstandard modes of movement are covered under this category, including\nclimbing (up to one-quarter of your speed) and swimming (up to one-quarter of\nyour speed).</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Accelerated\nClimbing:</span><span>\nYou can climb one-half your speed as a move action by accepting a –5 penalty on\nyour Climb check.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Crawling:</span><span> You can crawl 5 feet as a\nmove action. Crawling incurs attacks of opportunity from any attackers who\nthreaten you at any point of your crawl.</span></div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Draw or Sheathe a Weapon</div><div>Drawing\na weapon so that you can use it in combat, or putting it away so that you have\na free hand, requires a move action. This action also applies to weapon-like\nobjects carried in easy reach, such as wands. If your weapon or weapon-like\nobject is stored in a pack or otherwise out of easy reach, treat this action as\nretrieving a stored item.</div><div>If\nyou have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you may draw a weapon as a free\naction combined with a regular move. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting feat,\nyou can draw two light or one-handed weapons in the time it would normally take\nyou to draw one.</div><div>Drawing\nammunition for use with a ranged weapon (such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets,\nor shuriken) is a free action.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Ready or Loose a Shield</div><div>Strapping\na shield to your arm to gain its shield bonus to your AC, or unstrapping and\ndropping a shield so you can use your shield hand for another purpose, requires\na move action. If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you can ready\nor loose a shield as a free action combined with a regular move.</div><div>Dropping\na carried (but not worn) shield is a free action.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Manipulate an Item</div><div>In\nmost cases, moving or manipulating an item is a move action.</div><div>This\nincludes retrieving or putting away a stored item, picking up an item, moving a\nheavy object, and opening a door. Examples of this kind of action, along with\nwhether they incur an attack of opportunity, are given in Table: Actions in\nCombat.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Direct or Redirect a Spell</div><div>Some\nspellsallow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after\nyou cast the spell. Redirecting a spell requires a move action and does not\nprovoke attacks of opportunity or require concentration.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Stand Up</div><div>Standing\nup from a prone position requires a move action and provokes attacks of\nopportunity.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Mount/Dismount a Steed</div><div>Mounting\nor dismounting from a steed requires a move action.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Fast\nMount or Dismount:</span><span> You can mount or dismount as a free action with a DC 20 Ride\ncheck (your armor check penalty, if any, applies to this check). If you fail\nthe check, mounting or dismounting is a move action instead. (You can’t attempt\na fast mount or fast dismount unless you can perform the mount or dismount as a\nmove action in the current round.)</span></div><br><h3 id=\"full-round-actions\">FULL-ROUND ACTIONS</h3><div>A\nfull-round action requires an entire round to complete. Thus, it can’t be\ncoupled with a standard or a move action, though if it does not involve moving\nany distance, you can take a 5-foot step.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Full Attack</div><div>If\nyou get more than one attack per round because your base attack bonus is high\nenough, because you fight with two weapons or a double weapon or for some\nspecial reason you must use a full-round action to get your additional attacks.\nYou do not need to specify the targets of your attacks ahead of time. You can\nsee how the earlier attacks turn out before assigning the later ones.</div><div>The\nonly movement you can take during a full attack is a 5-foot step. You may take\nthe step before, after, or between your attacks.</div><div>If\nyou get multiple attacks because your base attack bonus is high enough, you\nmust make the attacks in order from highest bonus to lowest. If you are using\ntwo weapons, you can strike with either weapon first. If you are using a double\nweapon, you can strike with either part of the weapon first.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Deciding\nbetween an Attack or a Full Attack:</span><span> After your first attack, you can\ndecide to take a move action instead of making your remaining attacks,\ndepending on how the first attack turns out. If you’ve already taken a 5-foot\nstep, you can’t use your move action to move any distance, but you could still\nuse a different kind of move action.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Fighting\nDefensively as a Full-Round Action:</span><span> You can choose to fight defensively\nwhen taking a full attack action. If you do so, you take a –4 penalty on all\nattacks in a round to gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the same round.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Cleave:</span><span> The extra attack granted\nby the Cleave feat or Great Cleave feat can be taken whenever they apply. This\nis an exception to the normal limit to the number of attacks you can take when\nnot using a full attack action.</span></div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Cast a Spell</div><div>A\nspell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect\njust before the beginning of your turn in the round after you began casting the\nspell. You then act normally after the spell is completed.</div><div>A\nspell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1\nminute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a\nfull-round action). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the\nspell automatically fails.</div><div>When\nyou begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the\ninvocations, gestures, and concentration from one round to just before your\nturn in the next round (at least). If you lose concentration after starting the\nspell and before it is complete, you lose the spell.</div><div>You\nonly provoke attacks of opportunity when you begin casting a spell, even though\nyou might continue casting for at least one full round. While casting a spell,\nyou don’t threaten any squares around you.</div><div>This\naction is otherwise identical to the cast a spell action described under\nStandard Actions.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Casting\na Metamagic Spell:</span><span> Sorcerers and bards must take more time to cast a metamagic\nspell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than a regular spell. If a spell’s\nnormal casting time is 1 standard action, casting a metamagic version of the\nspell is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. Note that this isn’t the\nsame as a spell with a 1-round casting time—the spell takes effect in the same\nround that you begin casting, and you aren’t required to continue the\ninvocations, gestures, and concentration until your next turn. For spells with\na longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the\nmetamagic spell.</span></div><div>Clerics\nmust take more time to spontaneously cast a metamagic version of a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cure </span>or\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">inflict </span>spell.Spontaneously casting a metamagic version of a\nspell with a casting time of 1 standard action is a full-round action, and\nspells with longer casting times take an extra full-round action to cast.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Use Special Ability</div><div>Using\na special ability is usually a standard action, but some may be full-round\nactions, as defined by the ability.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Withdraw</div><div>Withdrawing\nfrom melee combat is a full-round action. When you withdraw, you can move up to\ndouble your speed. The square you start out in is not considered threatened by\nany opponent you can see, and therefore visible enemies do not get attacks of\nopportunity against you when you move from that square. (Invisible enemies\nstill get attacks of opportunity against you, and you can’t withdraw from\ncombat if you’re blinded.) You can’t take a 5-foot step during the same round\nin which you withdraw.</div><div>If,\nduring the process of withdrawing, you move out of a threatened square (other\nthan the one you started in), enemies get attacks of opportunity as normal.</div><div>You\nmay not withdraw using a form of movement for which you don’t have a listed\nspeed. </div><div>Note\nthat despite the name of this action, you don’t actually have to leave combat\nentirely.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Restricted\nWithdraw:</span><span>\nIf you are limited to taking only a standard action each round you can withdraw\nas a standard action. In this case, you may move up to your speed (rather than\nup to double your speed).</span></div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Run</div><div>You\ncan run as a full-round action. (If you do, you do not also get a 5-foot step.)\nWhen you run, you can move up to four times your speed in a straight line (or\nthree times your speed if you’re in heavy armor). You lose any Dexterity bonus\nto AC unless you have the Run feat </div><div>You\ncan run for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score, but after that\nyou must make a DC 10 Constitution check to continue running. You must check\nagain each round in which you continue to run, and the DC of this check\nincreases by 1 for each check you have made. When you fail this check, you must\nstop running. A character who has run to his limit must rest for 1 minute (10\nrounds) before running again. During a rest period, a character can move no\nfaster than a normal move action.</div><div>You\ncan’t run across difficult terrain or if you can’t see where you’re going.</div><div>A\nrun represents a speed of about 12 miles per hour for an unencumbered human.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Move 5 Feet through Difficult Terrain</div><div>In\nsome situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don’t have\nsufficient speed even to move 5 feet (a single square). In such a case, you may\nspend a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even\ndiagonally. Even though this looks like a 5-foot step, it’s not, and thus it\nprovokes attacks of opportunity normally.</div><br><h3 id=\"free-actions\">FREE ACTIONS</h3><div>Free\nactions don’t take any time at all, though there may be limits to the number of\nfree actions you can perform in a turn. Free actions rarely incur attacks of\nopportunity. Some common free actions are described below.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Drop an Item</div><div>Dropping\nan item in your space or into an adjacent square is a free action.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Drop Prone</div><div>Dropping\nto a prone position in your space is a free action.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Speak</div><div>In\ngeneral, speaking is a free action that you can perform even when it isn’t your\nturn. Speaking more than few sentences is generally beyond the limit of a free\naction.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Cease Concentration on Spell</div><div>You\ncan stop concentrating on an active spell as a free action.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Cast a Quickened Spell</div><div>You\ncan cast a quickened spell (see the Quicken Spell feat) or any spell whose\ncasting time is designated as a free action as a free action. Only one such\nspell can be cast in any round, and such spells don’t count toward your normal\nlimit of one spell per round. Casting a spell with a casting time of a free\naction doesn’t incur an attack of opportunity.</div><br><h3 id=\"miscellaneous-actions\">MISCELLANEOUS\nACTIONS</h3><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Take 5-Foot Step</div><div>You\ncan move 5 feet in any round when you don’t perform any other kind of movement.\nTaking this 5-foot step never provokes an attack of opportunity. You can’t take\nmore than one 5-foot step in a round, and you can’t take a 5-foot step in the\nsame round when you move any distance.</div><div>You\ncan take a 5-foot step before, during, or after your other actions in the\nround. </div><div>You\ncan only take a 5-foot-step if your movement isn’t hampered by difficult\nterrain or darkness. Any creature with a speed of 5 feet or less can’t take a\n5-foot step, since moving even 5 feet requires a move action for such a slow\ncreature.</div><div>You\nmay not take a 5-foot step using a form of movement for which you do not have a\nlisted speed. </div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Use Feat</div><div>Certain\nfeats let you take special actions in combat. Other feats do not require\nactions themselves, but they give you a bonus when attempting something you can\nalready do. Some feats are not meant to be used within the framework of combat.\nThe individual feat descriptions tell you what you need to know about them.</div><br><div style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Use Skill</div><div>Most\nskill uses are standard actions, but some might be move actions, full-round\nactions, free actions, or something else entirely.</div><div>The\nindividual skill descriptions tell you what sorts of actions are required to\nperform skills.</div><br><h2 id=\"injury-and-death\">INJURY\nAND DEATH</h2><div>Your\nhit points measure how hard you are to kill. No matter how many hit points you\nlose, your character isn’t hindered in any way until your hit points drop to 0\nor lower.</div><br><h3 id=\"loss-of-hit-points\">LOSS OF HIT POINTS</h3><div>The\nmost common way that your character gets hurt is to take lethal damage and lose\nhit points</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">What\nHit Points Represent:</span><span> Hit points mean two things in the game world: the ability to\ntake physical punishment and keep going, and the ability to turn a serious blow\ninto a less serious one.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Effects\nof Hit Point Damage:</span><span> Damage doesn’t slow you down until your current hit points\nreach 0 or lower. At 0 hit points, you’re disabled.</span></div><div>At\nfrom –1 to –9 hit points, you’re dying.</div><div>At\n–10 or lower, you’re dead.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Massive\nDamage: </span><span>If\nyou ever sustain a single attack deals 50 points of damage or more and it\ndoesn’t kill you outright, you must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. If this saving\nthrow fails, you die regardless of your current hit points. If you take 50\npoints of damage or more from multiple attacks, no one of which dealt 50 or\nmore points of damage itself, the massive damage rule does not apply.</span></div><br><h3 id=\"disabled-0-hit-points\">DISABLED (0 HIT\nPOINTS)</h3><div>When\nyour current hit points drop to exactly 0, you’re disabled.</div><div>You\ncan only take a single move or standard action each turn (but not both, nor can\nyou take full-round actions). You can take move actions without further\ninjuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other\nstrenuous action) you take 1 point of damage after the completing the act.\nUnless your activity increased your hit points, you are now at –1 hit points,\nand you’re dying.</div><div>Healing\nthat raises your hit points above 0 makes you fully functional again, just as\nif you’d never been reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.</div><div>You\ncan also become disabled when recovering from dying. In this case, it’s a step\ntoward recovery, and you can have fewer than 0 hit points (see Stable\nCharacters and Recovery, below).</div><br><h3 id=\"dying-1-to-9-hit-points\">DYING (–1 TO –9\nHIT POINTS)</h3><div>When\nyour character’s current hit points drop to between –1 and –9 inclusive, he’s\ndying.</div><div>A\ndying character immediately falls unconscious and can take no actions.</div><div>A\ndying character loses 1 hit point every round. This continues until the\ncharacter dies or becomes stable (see below).</div><br><h3 id=\"dead-10-hit-points-or-lower\">DEAD (–10 HIT\nPOINTS OR LOWER)</h3><div>When\nyour character’s current hit points drop to –10 or lower, or if he takes\nmassive damage (see above), he’s dead. A character can also die from taking\nability damage or suffering an ability drain that reduces his Constitution to\n0.</div><br><h3 id=\"stable-characters-and-recovery\">STABLE CHARACTERS\nAND RECOVERY</h3><div>On\nthe next turn after a character is reduced to between –1 and –9 hit points and\non all subsequent turns, roll d% to see whether the dying character becomes\nstable. He has a 10% chance of becoming stable. If he doesn’t, he loses 1 hit\npoint. (A character who’s unconscious or dying can’t use any special action\nthat changes the initiative count on which his action occurs.)</div><div>If\nthe character’s hit points drop to –10 or lower, he’s dead.</div><div>You\ncan keep a dying character from losing any more hit points and make him stable\nwith a DC 15 Heal check.</div><div>If\nany sort of healing cures the dying character of even 1 point of damage, he\nstops losing hit points and becomes stable.</div><div>Healing\nthat raises the dying character’s hit points to 0 makes him conscious and\ndisabled. Healing that raises his hit points to 1 or more makes him fully\nfunctional again, just as if he’d never been reduced to 0 or lower. A\nspellcaster retains the spellcasting capability she had before dropping below 0\nhit points.</div><div>A\nstable character who has been tended by a healer or who has been magically\nhealed eventually regains consciousness and recovers hit points naturally. If\nthe character has no one to tend him, however, his life is still in danger, and\nhe may yet slip away.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Recovering\nwith Help:</span><span>\nOne hour after a tended, dying character becomes stable, roll d%. He has a 10%\nchance of becoming conscious, at which point he is disabled (as if he had 0 hit\npoints). If he remains unconscious, he has the same chance to revive and become\ndisabled every hour. Even if unconscious, he recovers hit points naturally. He\nis back to normal when his hit points rise to 1 or higher.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Recovering\nwithout Help:</span><span>\nA severely wounded character left alone usually dies. He has a small chance,\nhowever, of recovering on his own. </span></div><div>A\ncharacter who becomes stable on his own (by making the 10% roll while dying)\nand who has no one to tend to him still loses hit points, just at a slower\nrate. He has a 10% chance each hour of becoming conscious. Each time he misses\nhis hourly roll to become conscious, he loses 1 hit point. He also does not\nrecover hit points through natural healing.</div><div>Even\nonce he becomes conscious and is disabled, an unaided character still does not\nrecover hit points naturally. Instead, each day he has a 10% chance to start\nrecovering hit points naturally (starting with that day); otherwise, he loses 1\nhit point.</div><div>Once\nan unaided character starts recovering hit points naturally, he is no longer in\ndanger of naturally losing hit points (even if his current hit point total is\nnegative).</div><br><h3 id=\"healing\">HEALING</h3><div>After\ntaking damage, you can recover hit points through natural healing or through\nmagical healing. In any case, you can’t regain hit points past your full normal\nhit point total.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Natural\nHealing:</span><span>\nWith a full night’s rest (8 hours of sleep or more), you recover 1 hit point\nper character level. Any significant interruption during your rest prevents you\nfrom healing that night.</span></div><div>If\nyou undergo complete bed rest for an entire day and night, you recover twice\nyour character level in hit points. </div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Magical\nHealing:</span><span>\nVarious abilities and spells can restore hit points.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Healing\nLimits:</span><span>\nYou can never recover more hit points than you lost. Magical healing won’t\nraise your current hit points higher than your full normal hit point total.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Healing\nAbility Damage:</span><span>\nAbility damage is temporary, just as hit point damage is. Ability damage\nreturns at the rate of 1 point per night of rest (8 hours) for each affected\nability score. Complete bed rest restores 2 points per day (24 hours) for each\naffected ability score.</span></div><br><h3 id=\"temporary-hit-points\">TEMPORARY HIT POINTS</h3><div>Certain\neffects give a character temporary hit points. When a character gains temporary\nhit points, note his current hit point total. When the temporary hit points go\naway the character’s hit points drop to his current hit point total. If the\ncharacter’s hit points are below his current hit point total at that time, all\nthe temporary hit points have already been lost and the character’s hit point\ntotal does not drop further.</div><div>When\ntemporary hit points are lost, they cannot be restored as real hit points can\nbe, even by magic.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Increases\nin Constitution Score and Current Hit Points: </span><span>An increase in a character’s\nConstitution score, even a temporary one, can give her more hit points (an\neffective hit point increase), but these are not temporary hit points. They can\nbe restored and they are not lost first as temporary hit points are.</span></div><br><h3 id=\"nonlethal-damage\">NONLETHAL DAMAGE</h3><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Dealing\nNonlethal Damage:</span><span> Certain attacks deal nonlethal damage. Other effects, such\nas heat or being exhausted, also deal nonlethal damage. When you take nonlethal\ndamage, keep a running total of how much you’ve accumulated. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Do not deduct\nthe nonlethal damage number from your current hit points. </span>It is not “real”\ndamage. Instead, when your nonlethal damage equals your current hit points,\nyou’re staggered, and when it exceeds your current hit points, you fall\nunconscious. It doesn’t matter whether the nonlethal damage equals or exceeds\nyour current hit points because the nonlethal damage has gone up or because\nyour current hit points have gone down.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nonlethal\nDamage with a Weapon that Deals Lethal Damage: </span><span>You can use a melee weapon that deals\nlethal damage to deal nonlethal damage instead, but you take a –4 penalty on\nyour attack roll.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lethal\nDamage with a Weapon that Deals Nonlethal Damage: </span><span>You can use a weapon that deals\nnonlethal damage, including an unarmed strike, to deal lethal damage instead,\nbut you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Staggered\nand Unconscious:</span><span>\nWhen your nonlethal damage equals your current hit points, you’re staggered.\nYou can only take a standard action or a move action in each round.
