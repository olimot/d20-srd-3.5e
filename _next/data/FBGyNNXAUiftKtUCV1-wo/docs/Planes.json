Except\nfor rare linking points, each plane is effectively its own universe with its\nown natural laws. </div><div>The planes\nbreak down into a number of general types: the Material Plane, the Transitive\nPlanes, the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, and the demiplanes.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Material\nPlane: </span><span>The\nMaterial Plane tends to be the most Earthlike of all planes and operates under\nthe same set of natural laws that our own real world does. This is the default\nplane for most adventures.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Transitive\nPlanes:</span><span>\nThese three planes have one important common characteristic: Each is used to\nget from one place to another. The Astral Plane is a conduit to all other\nplanes, while the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow both serve as means of\ntransportation within the Material Plane they’re connected to. These planes\nhave the strongest regular interaction with the Material Plane and are often\naccessed by using various spells. They have native inhabitants as well.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Inner\nPlanes:</span><span>\nThese six planes are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the\nuniverse. Each is made up of a single type of energy or element that overwhelms\nall others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same energy\nor element as the plane itself.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Outer\nPlanes:</span><span>\nThe deities live on the Outer Planes, as do creatures such as celestials,\ndemons, and devils. Each of the Outer Planes has an alignment, representing a\nparticular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of each plane tend to behave\nin agreement with that plane’s alignment. The Outer Planes are also the final\nresting place of souls from the Material Plane, whether that final rest takes\nthe form of calm introspection or eternal damnation.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Demiplanes:</span><span> This catch-all category\ncovers all extradimensional spaces that function like planes but have\nmeasurable size and limited access. Other kinds of planes are theoretically\ninfinite in size, but a demiplane might be only a few hundred feet across.</span></div><br><h3 id=\"planar-traits\">PLANAR TRAITS</h3><div>Each\nplane of existence has its own properties—the natural laws of its universe.</div><div>Planar\ntraits are broken down into a number of general areas.</div><br><div>All\nplanes have the following kinds of traits.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Physical\nTraits:</span><span>\nThese traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including\nhow gravity and time function.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Elemental\nand Energy Traits:</span><span> These traits determine the dominance of particular elemental\nor energy forces.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Alignment\nTraits:</span><span>\nJust as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many planes are tied\nto a particular moral or ethical outlook.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Magic\nTraits:</span><span>\nMagic works differently from plane to plane, and magic traits set the\nboundaries for what it can and can’t do.</span></div><br><h3 id=\"physical-traits\">Physical\nTraits</h3><div>The\ntwo most important natural laws set by physical traits are how gravity works\nand how time passes. Other physical traits pertain to the size and shape of a\nplane and how easily a plane’s nature can be altered.</div><br><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Gravity:</span><span> The direction of\ngravity’s pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the\nplane itself.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Normal\nGravity: </span><span>Most\nplanes have gravity similar to that of the Material Plane. The usual rules for\nability scores, carrying capacity, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise\nnoted in a description, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity trait.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Heavy\nGravity: </span><span>The\ngravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on the Material\nPlane. As a result, Balance, Climb, Jump, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks incur a\n–2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls. All item weights are\neffectively doubled, which might affect a character’s speed. Weapon ranges are\nhalved. A character’s Strength and Dexterity scores are not affected.\nCharacters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of damage for\neach 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Light\nGravity: </span><span>The\ngravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on the Material Plane.\nAs a result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their movements tend\nto be ungainly. Characters on a plane with the light gravity trait take a –2\ncircumstance penalty on attack rolls and Balance, Ride, Swim, and Tumble\nchecks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon ranges double, and characters gain\na +2 circumstance bonus on Climb and Jump checks.</span></div><div>Strength\nand Dexterity don’t change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do\nwith such scores does change. These advantages apply to travelers from other\nplanes as well as natives.</div><div>Falling\ncharacters on a light gravity plane take 1d4 points of damage for each 10 feet\nof the fall (maximum 20d4).</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">No\nGravity: </span><span>Individuals\non a plane with this trait merely float in space, unless other resources are\navailable to provide a direction for gravity’s pull.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Objective\nDirectional Gravity: </span><span>The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same\nas on the Material Plane, but the direction is not the traditional “down”\ntoward the ground. It may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the\nsurface of the plane itself, or even upward.</span></div><div>In\naddition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The\ndirection of “down” may vary.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Subjective\nDirectional Gravity: </span><span>The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the\nsame as on the Material Plane, but each individual chooses the direction of\ngravity’s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and\nnonsentient creatures. This sort of environment can be very disorienting to the\nnewcomer, but is common on “weightless” planes.</span></div><div>Characters\non a plane with subjective directional gravity can move normally along a solid\nsurface by imagining “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a\ncharacter “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and “falling” that way.\nUnder such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first round and\n300 feet in each succeeding round. Movement is straight-line only. In order to\nstop, one has to slow one’s movement by changing the designated “down”\ndirection (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and\n300 feet per round thereafter).</div><div>It\ntakes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action;\nthis check can be made once per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom\ncheck in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or\nshe succeeds.</div><br><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Time:</span><span> The rate of time’s passage\ncan vary on different planes, though it remains constant within any particular\nplane. Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies\nto various planes. Travelers may discover that they’ll pick up or lose time\nwhile moving among the planes, but from their point of view, time always passes\nnaturally.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Normal\nTime: </span><span>This\ntrait describes the way time passes on the Material Plane. One hour on a plane\nwith normal time equals one hour on the Material Plane. Unless otherwise noted\nin a description, every plane has the normal time trait.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Timeless:\n</span><span>On planes\nwith this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. How\nthe timeless trait can affect certain activities or conditions such as hunger,\nthirst, aging, the effects of poison, and healing varies from plane to plane.</span></div><div>The\ndanger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where\ntime flows normally, conditions such as hunger and aging do occur\nretroactively. </div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Flowing\nTime: </span><span>On\nsome planes, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane,\nspend a year there, then return to the Material Plane to find that only six\nseconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds\nolder. But for that traveler and the items, spells, and effects working on him,\nthat year away was entirely real.</span></div><div>When\ndesignating how time works on planes with flowing time, put the Material\nPlane’s flow of time first, followed by the same flow in the other plane. </div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Erratic\nTime: </span><span>Some\nplanes have time that slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or\ngain time as he moves between the two planes. The following is provided as an\nexample.</span></div><div class=\"table-container\"><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border: 0px none rgb(128, 128, 128); width: 22em; padding: 0px;\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 7.5em;\">d%</td><td width=\"101\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 7.12em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Time\n  on Material Plane</td><td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 7.2em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Time\n  on Erratic Time Plane</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding: 0px 0.52em; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 7.5em;\">01–10</td><td width=\"101\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 7.8em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">1\n  day</td><td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 7.5em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">1\n  round</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding: 0px 0.52em; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 7.12em;\">11–40</td><td width=\"101\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 8.17em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">1\n  day</td><td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 7.65em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">1\n  hour</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding: 0px 0.52em; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 6.9em;\">41–60</td><td width=\"101\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 8.4em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">1\n  day</td><td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 7.65em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">1\n  day</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding: 0px 0.52em; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 6.82em;\">61–90</td><td width=\"101\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 8.55em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">1\n  hour</td><td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 7.65em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">1\n  day</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" style=\"border: 0px none rgb(0, 0, 0); padding: 0px 0.52em; text-align: center; width: 6.82em;\">91–100</td><td width=\"101\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 8.55em; border: 0px none rgb(0, 0, 0); padding: 0px 0.52em;\">1\n  round</td><td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 7.65em; border: 0px none rgb(0, 0, 0); padding: 0px 0.52em;\">1\n  day</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>To\nthe denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally and the shift is unnoticed.</div><div>If\na plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a\nnoninstantaneous duration is permanent until dispelled.</div><br><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Shape\nand Size:</span><span>\nPlanes come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most planes are infinite, or at\nleast so large that they may as well be infinite.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Infinite:\n</span><span>Planes\nwith this trait go on forever, though they may have finite components within\nthem. Or they may consist of ongoing expanses in two directions, like a map\nthat stretches out infinitely.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Finite\nShape: </span><span>A\nplane with this trait has defined edges or borders. These borders may adjoin\nother planes or hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a great\nwall. Demiplanes are often finite.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Self-Contained\nShape: </span><span>On\nplanes with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the\ntraveler on the other side of the map. A spherical plane is an example of a\nself-contained, finite plane, but there can be cubes, toruses, and flat planes\nwith magical edges that teleport the traveler to an opposite edge when he\ncrosses them. </span></div><div>Some\ndemiplanes are self-contained.</div><br><div><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Morphic\nTraits:</span><span>\nThis trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane can be changed. Some\nplanes are responsive to sentient thought, while others can be manipulated only\nby extremely powerful creatures. And some planes respond to physical or magical\nefforts.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Alterable\nMorphic: </span><span>On\na plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they are)\nunless affected by physical force or magic. You can change the immediate\nenvironment as a result of tangible effort. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Highly\nMorphic: </span><span>On\na plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that it’s\ndifficult to keep a particular area stable. Such planes may react dramatically\nto specific spells, sentient thought, or the force of will. Others change for\nno reason. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Magically\nMorphic: </span><span>Specific\nspells can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Divinely\nMorphic: </span><span>Specific\nunique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the ability to alter\nobjects, creatures, and the landscape on planes with this trait. Ordinary\ncharacters find these planes similar to alterable planes in that they may be\naffected by spells and physical effort. But the deities may cause these areas\nto change instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for themselves. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Static:\n</span><span>These\nplanes are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the plane,\nnor objects that the denizens possess. Any spells that would affect those on\nthe plane have no effect unless the plane’s static trait is somehow removed or\nsuppressed. Spells cast before entering a plane with the static trait remain in\neffect, however.</span></div><div>Even\nmoving an unattended object within a static plane requires a DC 16 Strength\ncheck. Particularly heavy objects may be impossible to move.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sentient:\n</span><span>These\nplanes are ones that respond to a single thought— that of the plane itself.\nTravelers would find the plane’s landscape changing as a result of what the\nplane thought of the travelers, either becoming more or less hospitable\ndepending on its reaction.</span></div><br><h3 id=\"elemental-and-energy-traits\">Elemental and\nEnergy Traits</h3><div>Four basic\nelements and two types of energy together make up everything. The elements are\nearth, air, fire, and water. The types of energy are positive and negative.</div><div>The Material\nPlane reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all are found there.\nEach of the Inner Planes is dominated by one element or type of energy. Other\nplanes may show off various aspects of these elemental traits. Many planes have\nno elemental or energy traits; these traits are noted in a plane’s description\nonly when they are present.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Air-Dominant:</span><span> Mostly open space, planes\nwith this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They\nusually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of\nacidic or toxic gas. Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on\nair-dominant planes because they have little or no natural earth to connect\nwith. They take no actual damage, however.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Earth-Dominant:</span><span> Planes with this trait\nare mostly solid. Travelers who arrive run the risk of suffocation if they\ndon’t reach a cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals\nwithout the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig their way\nout (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on earth\ndominant planes because these planes are tight and claustrophobic to them. But\nthey suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fire-Dominant:\n</span><span>Planes\nwith this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming\ntheir fuel source. Fire-dominant planes are extremely hostile to Material Plane\ncreatures, and those without resistance or immunity to fire are soon immolated.</span></div><div>Unprotected\nwood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost\nimmediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch on fire. In\naddition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire damage every round they are on a\nfire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable\non fire-dominant planes. Those that are made of water take double damage each\nround.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Water-Dominant:</span><span> Planes with this trait\nare mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach a pocket of air\nwill likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on\nwater-dominant planes. Those made of fire take 1d10 points of damage each\nround.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Positive-Dominant:\n</span><span>An\nabundance of life characterizes planes with this trait. The two kinds of\npositive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major\npositive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of\nlife in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are\nlouder, and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive energy\nswirling through the plane. All individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain\nfast healing 2 as an extraordinary ability.</span></div><div>Major\npositive-dominant planes go even further. A creature on a major\npositive-dominant plane must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being blinded\nfor 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the plane\ngrants fast healing 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full\nhit points gain 5 additional temporary hit points per round. These temporary\nhit points fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive-\ndominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round\nthat its temporary hit points exceed its normal hit point total. Failing the\nsaving throw results in the creature exploding in a riot of energy, killing it.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Negative-Dominant:</span><span> Planes with this trait\nare vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them.\nThey tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color and filled with winds\nbearing the soft moans of those who died within them. As with positive-dominant\nplanes, negative-dominant planes can be either minor or major. On minor\nnegative-dominant planes, living creatures take 1d6 points of damage per round.\nAt 0 hit points or lower, they crumble into ash.</span></div><div>Major\nnegative-dominant planes are even more severe. Each round, those within must\nmake a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A creature whose negative\nlevels equal its current levels or Hit Dice is slain, becoming a wraith. The <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">death\nward </span>spell protects a traveler from the damage and energy drain of a\nnegative-dominant plane.</div><br><h3 id=\"alignment-traits\">Alignment\nTraits</h3><div>Some planes\nhave a predisposition to a certain alignment. Most of the inhabitants of these\nplanes also have the plane’s particular alignment, even powerful creatures such\nas deities. In addition, creatures of alignments contrary to the plane have a\ntougher time dealing with its natives and situations.</div><div>The\nalignment trait of a plane affects social interactions there. Characters who\nfollow other alignments than most of the inhabitants do may find life more\ndifficult.</div><div>Alignment\ntraits have multiple components. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical\n(lawful or chaotic) components; a plane can have either a moral component, an\nethical component, or one of each. Second, the specific alignment trait\nindicates whether each moral or ethical component is mildly or strongly\nevident.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned:\n</span><span>These\nplanes have chosen a side in the battle of good versus evil. No plane can be\nboth good-aligned and evil-aligned.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned:</span><span> Law versus chaos is the\nkey struggle for these planes and their residents. No plane can be both\nlaw-aligned and chaos-aligned.</span></div><br><div>Each\npart of the moral/ethical alignment trait has a descriptor, either “mildly” or\n“strongly,” to show how powerful the influence of alignment is on the plane.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Mildly\nAligned: </span><span>Creatures\nwho have an alignment opposite that of a mildly aligned plane take a –2\ncircumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Strongly\nAligned:</span><span>\nOn planes that are strongly aligned, a –2 circumstance penalty applies on all\nCharisma-based checks made by all creatures not of the plane’s alignment. In\naddition, the –2 penalty affects all Intelligence-based and Wisdom-based\nchecks, too.</span></div><div>The penalties\nfor the moral and ethical components of the alignment trait do stack.</div><br><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Neutral-Aligned:</span><span> A mildly neutral-aligned\nplane does not apply a circumstance penalty to anyone.</span></div><div>The\nMaterial Plane is considered mildly neutral-aligned, though it may contain high\nconcentrations of evil or good, law or chaos in places.</div><div>A\nstrongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to all other moral and\nethical principles: good, evil, law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more\nconcerned with the balance of the alignments than with accommodating and\naccepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly\naligned planes, strongly neutral-aligned planes apply a –2 circumstance penalty\nto Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based checks by any creature that isn’t\nneutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for good/evil),\nso neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures\ntake a –2 penalty and lawful good, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil\ncreatures take a –4 penalty.</div><br><h3 id=\"magic-traits\">Magic Traits</h3><div>A plane’s magic\ntrait describes how magic works on the plane compared to how it works on the\nMaterial Plane. Particular locations on a plane (such as those under the direct\ncontrol of deities) may be pockets where a different magic trait applies.</div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Normal\nMagic:</span><span>\nThis magic trait means that all spells and supernatural abilities function as\nwritten. Unless otherwise noted in a description, every plane has the normal\nmagic trait.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Wild\nMagic:</span><span> On\na plane with the wild magic trait spells and spell-like abilities function in\nradically different and sometimes dangerous ways. Any spell or spell-like\nability used on a wild magic plane has a chance to go awry. The caster must\nmake a level check (DC 15 + the level of the spell or effect) for the magic to\nfunction normally. For spell-like abilities, use the level or HD of the\ncreature employing the ability for the caster level check and the level of the\nspell-like ability to set the DC for the caster level check. Failure on this\ncheck means that something strange happens; roll d% and consult the following\ntable.</span></div><br><div class=\"table-container\"><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border: 0px none rgb(128, 128, 128); width: 53.7em; padding: 0px;\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"61\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 5.62em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">d%</td><td width=\"625\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 54.1em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Effect</td></tr><tr><td width=\"61\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 6.07em; padding: 0px 0.52em; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">01–19</td><td width=\"625\" valign=\"top\" style=\"width: 55.7em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Spell\n  rebounds on caster with normal effect.

These planes overlap each other completely. A coexistent plane can\nbe reached from anywhere on the plane it overlaps. When moving on a coexistent\nplane, it is often possible to see into or interact with the plane it coexists\nwith. </span></div><br><div>Layered\nPlanes</div><div>Infinities\nmay be broken into smaller infinities, and planes into smaller, related planes.\nThese layers are effectively separate planes of existence, and each layer can\nhave its own planar traits. Layers are connected to each other through a\nvariety of planar gates, natural vortices, paths, and shifting borders.</div><div>Access\nto a layered plane from elsewhere usually happens on a specific layer: the\nfirst layer of the plane, which can be either the top layer or the bottom\nlayer, depending on the specific plane. Most fixed access points (such as\nportals and natural vortices) reach this layer, which makes it the gateway for\nother layers of the plane.

The Material Plane itself is visible from the Ethereal Plane, but it\nappears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges\nturning fuzzy.</div><div>While it is\npossible to see into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane, the Ethereal\nPlane is usually invisible to those on the Material Plane. Normally, creatures\non the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice\nversa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible, incorporeal, and utterly\nsilent to someone on the Material Plane. </div><div>The\nEthereal Plane is mostly empty of structures and impediments. However, the\nplane has its own inhabitants. Some of these are other ethereal travelers, but\nthe ghosts found here pose a particular peril to those who walk the fog. </div><div>It\nhas the following traits.</div><div>•\nNo gravity.</div><div>•\nAlterable morphic. The plane contains little to alter, however.</div><div>•\nMildly neutral-aligned.</div><div>•\nNormal magic. Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though they do\nnot cross into the Material Plane. </div><div>The\nonly exceptions are spells and spell-like abilities that have the force\ndescriptor and abjuration spells that affect ethereal beings. Spellcasters on\nthe Material Plane must have some way to detect foes on the Ethereal Plane\nbefore targeting them with force-based spells, of course.

Spells that use or generate light or fire may fizzle when cast\non the Plane of Shadow. A spellcaster attempting a spell with the light or fire\ndescriptor must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + the level of the spell).\nSpells that produce light are less effective in general, because all light\nsources have their ranges halved on the Plane of Shadow.</div><div>Despite\nthe dark nature of the Plane of Shadow, spells that produce, use, or manipulate\ndarkness are unaffected by the plane.</div><br><h3 id=\"the-astral-plane\">THE ASTRAL PLANE</h3><div>The\nAstral Plane is the space between the planes.
